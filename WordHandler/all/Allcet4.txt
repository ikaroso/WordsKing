Part II　　　　　     Reading Comprehension　　   　　(35 minutes) Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre. Passage One Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage. 　　Some pessimistic experts feel that the automobile is bound to fall into disuse. They see a day in the not-too-distant future when all autos will be abandoned and allowed to rust. Other authorities, however, think the auto is here to stay. They hold that the car will remain a leading means of urban travel in the foreseeable future. 　　The motorcar will undoubtedly change significantly over the next 30 years. It should become smaller, safer, and more economical, and should not be powered by the gasoline engine. The car of the future should be far more pollution-free than present types. 　　Regardless of its power source, the auto in the future will still be the main problem in urban traffic congestion (拥挤). One proposed solution to this problem is the automated highway system. 　　When the auto enters the highway system, a retractable (可伸缩的) arm will drop from the auto and make contact with a rail, which is similar to those powering subway trains electrically. Once attached to the rail, the car will become electrically powered from the system, and control of the vehicle will pass to a central computer. The computer will then monitor all of the car's movements. The driver will use a telephone to dial instructions about his destination into the system. The computer will calculate the best route, and reserve space for the car all the way to the correct exit from the highway. The driver will then be free to relax and wait for the buzzer (蜂鸣器) that will warn him of his coming exit. It is estimated that an automated highway will be able to handle 10,000 vehicles per hour, compared with the 1,500 to 2,000 vehicles that can be carried by a present-day highway. 21. One significant improvement in the future car will probably be________. 　　A) its power source　 B) its driving system　 C) its monitoring system　　　　　　　　　D) its seating capacity 22. What is the author's main concern? 　　A) How to render automobiles pollution-free. 　　B) How to make smaller and safer automobiles. 　　C) How to solve the problem of traffic jams. D) How to develop an automated subway system. 23. What provides autos with electric power in an automated highway system? 　　A) A rail. B) An engine. 　 C) A retractable arm.　　　　　　　　　　　　D) A computer controller. 24. In an automated highway system, all the driver needs to do is _______. 　　A) keep in the right lane 　　B) wait to arrive at his destination 　　C) keep in constant touch with the computer center D) inform the system of his destination by phone 25. What is the author's attitude toward the future of autos? 　　A) Enthusiastic.　 		B) Pessimistic. 		C) Optimistic. 		D) Cautious. Passage Two Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage. 　　Foxes and farmers have never got on well. These small dog-like animals have long been accused of killing farm animals. They are officially classified as harmful and farmers try to keep their numbers down by shooting or poisoning them. 　　Farmers can also call on the services of their local hunt to control the fox population. Hunting consists of pursuing a fox across the countryside, with a group of specially trained dogs, followed by men and women riding horses. When the dogs eventually catch the fox they kill it or a hunter shoots it. 　　People who take part in hunting think of it as a sport; they wear a special uniform of red coats and white trousers, and follow strict codes of behavior. But owning a horse and hunting regularly is expensive, so most hunters are wealthy. 　　It is estimated that up to 100,000 people watch or take part in fox hunting. But over the last couple of decades the number of people opposed to fox hunting, because they think it is brutal (残酷的), has risen sharply. Nowadays it is rare for a hunt to pass off without some kind of confrontation (冲突) between hunters and hunt saboteurs (阻拦者). Sometimes these incidents lead to violence, but mostly saboteurs interfere with the hunt by misleading riders and disturbing the trail of the fox's smell, which the dogs follow. Noisy confrontations between hunters and saboteurs have become so common that they are almost as much a part of hunting as the pursuit of foxes itself. But this year supporters of fox hunting face a much bigger threat to their sport. A Labour Party Member of the Parliament, Mike Foster, is trying to get Parliament to approve a new law which will make the hunting of wild animals with dogs illegal. If the law is passed, wild animals like foxes will be protected under the ban in . 26. Rich people in  have been hunting foxes_____.　　A) for recreation B) in the interests of the farmers　 C) to limit the fox population　D) to show of their wealth 27. What is special about fox hunting in ? 　　A) It involves the use of a deadly poison. 　　B) It is a costly event which rarely occurs. 　　C) The hunters have set rules to follow. D) The hunters have to go through strict training. 28. Fox hunting opponents often interfere in the game________. 　　A) by resorting to violence B) by confusing the fox hunters C) by taking legal action　D) by demonstrating on the scene 29. A new law may be passed by the British Parliament to________. 　　A) prohibit farmers from hunting foxes 　　B) forbid hunting foxes with dogs 　　C) stop hunting wild animals in the countryside D) prevent large-scale fox hunting 30. It can be inferred from the passage that ________. 　　A) killing foxes with poison is illegal 　　B) limiting the fox population is unnecessary 　　C) hunting foxes with dogs is considered cruel and violent D) fox-hunting often leads to confrontation between the poor and the rich Passage Three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage. 　　For an increasing number of students at American universities, Old is suddenly in. The reason is obvious: the graying of  means jobs. Coupled with the aging of the baby-boom (生育高峰) generation, a longer life span means that the nation's elderly population is bound to expand significantly over the next 50 years. By 2050, 25 percent of all Americans will be older than 65, up from 14 percent in 1995. The change poses profound questions for government and society, of course. But it also creates career opportunities in medicine and health professions, and in law and business as well. "In addition to the doctors, we're going to need more sociologists, biologists, urban planners and specialized lawyers," says Professor Edward Schneider of the University of Southern California's (USC) School of Gerontology (老年学). 　　Lawyers can specialize in "elder law," which covers everything from trusts and estates to nursing-home abuse and age discrimination (歧视). Businessmen see huge opportunities in the elder market because the baby boomers, 74 million strong, are likely to be the wealthiest group of retirees in human history. "Any student who combines an expert knowledge in gerontology with, say, an MBA or law degree will have a license to print money," one professor says. Margarite  is a 21-year-old senior at USC. She began college as a biology major but found she was "really bored with bacteria.” So she took a class in gerontology and discovered that she liked it. She says, "I did volunteer work in retirement homes and it was very satisfying." 31. "…old is suddenly in" (Line 1, Para. 1) most probably means"______". 　　A)  has suddenly become a nation of old people 　　B) gerontology has suddenly become popular 　　C) more elderly professors are found on American campuses D) American colleges have realized the need of enrolling older students 32. With the aging of , lawyers can benefit ______. 　　A) from the adoption of the "elder law" 　　B) from rendering special services to the elderly 　　C) by enriching their professional knowledge D) by winning the trust of the elderly to promote their own interests 33. Why can businessmen make money in the emerging elder market? 　　A) Retirees are more generous in spending money. 　　B) They can employ more gerontologists. 　　C) The elderly possess an enormous purchasing power. D) There are more elderly people working than before. 34. Who can make big money in the new century according to the passage? 　　A) Retirees who are business-minded. 　　B) The volunteer workers in retirement homes. 　　C) College graduates with an MBA or law degree. D) Professionals with a good knowledge of gerontology. 35. It can be seen from the passage that the expansion of 's elderly population ________. 　　A) will provide good job opportunities in many areas 　　B) will impose an unbearable burden on society 　　C) may lead to nursing home abuse and age discrimination D) will create new fields of study in universities Passage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage. The decline in moral standards-which has long concerned social analysts-has at last captured the attention of average Americans. And Jean Bethke Elshtain, for one, is glad. 　　The fact that ordinary citizens are now starting to think seriously about the nation's moral climate, says this ethics (伦理学) professor at the University of Chicago, is reason to hope that new ideas will come forward to improve it. 　　But the challenge is not to be underestimated. Materialism and individualism in American society are the biggest obstacles. "The thought that 'I'm in it for me' has become deeply rooted in the national consciousness," Ms. Elshtain says. 　　Some of this can be attributed to the disintegration of traditional communities, in which neighbors looked out for one another, she says. With today's greater mobility and with so many couples working, those bonds have been weakened, replaced by a greater emphasis on self. 　　In a 1996 poll of Americans, loss of morality topped the list of the biggest problems facing the  And Elshtain says the public is correct to sense that: Data show that Americans are struggling with problems unheard of in the 1950s, such as classroom violence and a high rate of births to unmarried mothers. The desire for a higher moral standard is not a lament (挽歌) for some nonexistent "golden age," Elshtain says, nor is it a wishful ( 一厢情愿的 ) longing for a time that denied opportunities to women and minorities. Most people, in fact, favor the lessening of prejudice. Moral decline will not be reversed until people find ways to counter the materialism in society, she says. "Slowly, you recognize that the things that matter are those that can't be bought."36. Professor Elshtain is pleased to see that Americans________. 　　A) have adapted to a new set of moral standards 　　B) are longing for the return of the good old days 　　C) have realized the importance of material things D) are awakening to the lowering of their moral standards 37. The moral decline of American society is caused mainly by______.　　A) its growing wealth 　　B) the self-centeredness of individuals 　　C) underestimating the impact of social changes D) the prejudice against women and minorities 38. Which of the following characterizes the traditional communities? 　　A) Great mobility. B) Concern for one's neighbors. C) Emphasis on individual effort.　 D) Ever-weakening social bonds. 39. In the 1950s, classroom violence_____.　　A) was something unheard of B) was by no means a rare occurrence C) attracted a lot of public attention D) began to appear in analysts' data 40. According to Elshtain, the current moral decline may be reversed______.　　A) if people can return to the "golden age" 　　B) when women and men enjoy equal rights 　　C) when people rid themselves of prejudice 　　D) if less emphasis is laid on material things Part III　　　　　　		Vocabulary and Structure　　　　(20 minutes) Directions: There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

He could learn to say any word except one. He could not say the name of his native town, Ketunnel. The man did everything he could to teach the parrot to say Ketunnel, but he never succeeded. At first he was very gentle with the bird. But gradually, he lost his temper. "You stupid bird. Why can't you learn to say that one word? Say Ketunnel or I will kill you." But the parrot would not say it. Many times the man screamed, "Say Ketunel, or I'll kill you." But the bird would never repeat the name. Finally, the man gave up. He picked up the parrot and threw him into the chicken house. "You are even more stupid than the chickens." In the chicken house, there were four old chickens, waiting to be killed for Sunday's dinner. The next morning, when he went out of the chicken house, the man opened the door. He was shocked by what he saw. He could not believe his eyes and ears. On the floor lay three dead chickens. The parrot was screaming at the fourth, "Say Ketunel, or I'll kill you." 11. Why did the man lose his temper? 12. Who killed the three chickens? 13. Why was the shocked at the scene the next morning? Passage 2 　　In , if you are found guilty of a crime, you can be sent to prison or be fined or be ordered to do community work such as tidying public places and helping the old. You may also be sent to special centers when you learn special skills like cooking, writing and car maintenance. About 5 percent of the present population are women. Many prisons were built over one hundred years ago. But the government will have built 11 new prisons by next year. There are two sorts of prisons___the open sort and the closed sort. In the closed sort, prisoners are given very little freedom. They spend three to ten hours outside their cells when they exercise, eat, study, learn skills, watch TV and talk to other prisoners. All prisoners are expected to work. Most of them are paid for what they do, whether it is doing maintenance or cooking and cleaning. Prisoners in open prisons are locked up at night, but for the rest of the time, they are free within the prison grounds. They can exercise, have visitors, or study. And some are allowed out of the ground to study or to do community work. 14. What do we know about women prisoners in ? 15. In what way are open prisons different from closed prisons? 16. What do we learn about prisoners in ? Passage 3 　　 taxi drivers know the capital like the back of their hands. No matter how small or indistinct the street is, the driver will be able to get you there without any trouble. The reason  taxi drivers are so efficient is that they all have gone through a very tough training period to get special taxi driving license. During this period, which can take two to four years, the would-be taxi driver has to learn the most direct route to every single road and to every important building in . To achieve this, most learners go around the city on small motorbikes practicing how to move to and from different points of the city. Learner taxi drivers are tested several times during the training period by government officers. The exams are terrible experience. The officers ask you "How do you get from  palace to the ?" and you have to take them there in the direct line. When you get to the tower, they won't say "well done". They will quickly move on to the next question. After five or six questions, they will just say "See you in two months' time." and then you know the exam is over. Learner drivers are not allowed to work and earn money as drivers. Therefore, many of them keep their previous jobs until they have obtained the license. The training can cost quite a lot, because learners have to pay for their own expenses on the tests and the medical exam. 17. Why are  taxi drivers very efficient? 18. How long does the training period last? 19. Why does the speaker think the driving test is a terrible experience? 20. Why do learner drivers have to keep their present jobs?Part II	 comprehensionPassage One 译文	一些悲观的专家感到汽车注定要被废弃。他们看到不久的将来有一天所有的汽车都会被抛弃，任其生锈。然而，别的权威们认为汽车还会存在。他们认为在可预见的未来的汽车仍将是城市交通的主要手段。	在以后30年中汽车毫无疑问会有重大变化。它应该变得更小、更安全和更经济，而且不应当由汽油发动机驱动。未来的汽车应当比现在的汽车更无污染。	无论用什么能源，将来的汽车都将依然是城市交通拥挤的主要问题。对这个问题提出的一个解决办法就是自动公路系统。	当汽车进入公路系统，一支伸缩臂从车上落下与铁轨接触，这种铁轨同给地下列车供电的铁轨相似。一旦与铁轨连接，汽车就由系统供电，汽车的操纵交给中心计算机。然后计算机将监控汽车的一切状况。	驾驶员将用电话将目的地的指令拨入监控系统。计算机将计算出最佳线路并且为汽车预留通道，使它一路畅通直达正确的公路出口。然后司机可以自由休息，只等蜂鸣器提醒他到了出口。估计自动公路每小时能够运送一万辆车，而现在的公路每小时只能运送一千五百到两千辆。21. [C] 从本题的题干来看，未来汽车比较显著的一种变化应该是不同一般的，也应该是文章所着重要介绍的。文章大部分篇幅所介绍的是未来监控系统，所以本题答案应该是C。 22. [C] 从文章第三段the auto in the future will still be the main problem in urban traffic congestion来看，作者主要关心的还是如何解决交通堵塞的问题，即C。 23. [A] 根据常识来判断，"可伸缩得手臂 "只是用来连接汽车与铁轨的工具，是能源的传导器，也就是说，提供能源的不是"可伸缩的手臂"，而"铁轨"，所以答案为A。 24. [D] 文章的最后一段the driver will use a telephone to dial instructions about his destination into system说明本题的答案为D，即在计算机监控系统下，司机所做的不过是通过电话告诉系统自己的目的地而已。 25. [C] 从作者对计算机监控系统的使用来看，作者对自行车的前景是抱乐观态度的，所以答案为C。 Passage Two 译文	狐狸和农场主从来就不能和睦相处。这些小的象狗的动物一直因为咬死农场动物而受到谴责。狐狸被正式划为有害动物，农场主通过枪死和毒杀减少它们的数目。	农场主还可以要求当地人帮助追猎以控制狐狸的数目。追猎就是用一群经专门训练的狗在乡村追杀狐狸，后面跟着骑马的男人和女人。当狗终于抓住狐狸的时候。狗咬死它或者猎人枪杀它。	参加追猎的人把它看成是一项运动，他们穿着红上衣白裤子的特别制服，严格遵守一些规则行动。但拥有一匹马和定期追猎很昂贵，所以大多数猎手都是有钱人。	据估计高达十万人观看或者参加与追猎狐狸。但是最近几十年反对猎杀狐狸的人数急剧上升，因为他们认为这样做很残酷。现在几乎没有哪一次狩猎不因狩猎者和阻拦者之间发生某种冲突而告终。有时这些事件导致暴力，但大多数阻拦者都是通过误导骑马的或打乱猎犬跟踪的狐狸嗅迹来干预狩猎。	狩猎者和阻拦者之间发生的喧嚣冲突很寻常，几乎成为整个狩猎过程中与追捕狐狸本身同等重要的一部分。但是今年猎狐支持者面对这项运动的更大威胁。议会工党员迈克·福斯特力图让议会批准一项使用狗来猎取野生动物为非法的新法律。如果这项法律通过获得，像狐狸这样的野生动物将在英国禁止令下得到保护。26. [A] 从短文第三段People who take part in hunting think of it as a sport可以判断，英国人猎狐是作为一种娱乐和消遣，所以答案为A。 27. [C] 从文章第三段and follow strict codes of behavior来看，英国人猎狐是又严格规定的，从而说明答案为C。文章第一段虽然提到or poisoning them但下毒却不属于猎狐的范畴，所以A不对。 28. [B] 本题为细节判断题，文章第四段interfere with the hunt by misleading riders and disturbing the trail of the fox's smell说明答案为B。 29. [B] 本题也是细节理解题，文章最后提到a new law which will make hunting of wild animals with dogs illegal说明法律禁止带狗狩猎。 30. [C] 文章倒数第二段叙述了带狗狩猎被禁止的原因，because they think it is brutal 可以判断，带着狗狩猎被认为是一种很残酷的行为。 译文	对越来越多的美国大学生来说，老年学突然时髦起来。理由很明显：美国的人口老龄化意味一些就业机会。随着生育高峰一代的老龄化，人的寿命延长就意味着全国老年人口在今后50年内必然有相当大的增长。到2050年，65岁以上的美国人将从1995年的14%增长到25%。当然，这种变化给政府和社会提出一些深刻的问题。但是这也在医药卫生界以及法律和商业界创造了就业机会。南加利弗尼亚大学老年学学院的爱德华·施奈德说：“除了大夫，我们将迫切需要有更多的社会学家、生物学家、城市规划人员和专业律师。”	律师可以成为“老年人法”专家，“老年人法”包括从财产委托、房地产到敬老院虐待和年龄歧视。商人在老年人市场看到巨大的商机，因为生育高峰期人数高达七千四百万的产儿很可能将成为人类历史上最富有的退休群体。一位教授说：“任何学生只要有老年学的专门知识，又有一个学位，例如工商管理学硕士或法律学位，就如同有印制钞票的许可证一般”。	玛格丽特·桑托斯是南加利弗尼亚大学的一名21岁的四年级学生。她上大学时是个生物学学生，但是她发现“实在厌烦细菌”。所以她上一堂老年学课程，发现很喜欢这门课程。她说：“我在退休老人福利院做志愿者，这使我非常满意。”31. [B] 本题的理解要结合上下文，从全文来看，本篇文章所介绍的是老年学的问题，所以Old is suddenly in指的是老年学突然流行起来。 32. [A] 文章的细节都应该与文章的主题有关，从Lawyers can specialize in "elder law"来看，本题答案为A，即律师可以从老年法律中获益。 33. [A] 文章第二段中are likely to be the wealthiest group of retirees in human history说明了商人之所以能从老年市场获益的原因，是因为这部分退休的老年都十分富有，并且肯为下一代花钱。 34. [D] 文章提到any student who combines an expert knowledge in gerontology with, say, and MBA or law degree will have a license to print money，但是C只说是拥有MBA或法律学位证书的毕业生，而文章说这些资格应该与老年学专业知识结合，D符合这一点，professionals可以指在在MBA或律师专业比较优秀的人士，所以答案为D。 35. [A]从文章第一段it also creates career opportunities in medicine and health professionals, and in law and business as well说明美国老龄人口的增加会在很过领域提供就业机会。选项D是事实，不属于推理的结论，不符合题意。 Passage Four 译文	社会分析家关注很久的道德水准下降问题终于引起了普通美国人的注意。作为一名社会分析家，简·比思克·艾尔顿很高兴。	普通美国公民现在已经开始严肃思考国民道德风气问题，这使我们有理由希望会产生新思想以改进这种状况，芝加哥大学伦理教授说。	但是不要低估这种挑战。美国社会的功利主义者是两个最大的障碍。艾尔斯顿女士说：“‘我干这事是为自己的’的思想深深植根于民族意识之中。”	她说：其中某些方面应归咎于邻里之间的互相关照的传统社区的解体。由于当今流动性更大，很多夫妻都工作，这种联系已经被削弱，取而代之的是更加强调自我。	1996年的一项美国民意测验中，道德沦丧名列美国所面临的是最大问题的榜首。艾尔斯顿说，公众认识到这点是正确的：资料表明美国人正在与50年代从未听到过的问题作斗争，如：教室暴力、未婚母亲生育率。	艾尔斯顿说，提高道德水准的愿望不是对某个并不存在的“黄金时代”的挽歌，也不是对一个曾拒绝给妇女和少数民族以机会的时代一厢情愿的愿望。实际上，大多数人赞成减少歧视。	她说，直到人们克服社会上功利主义的办法时，道德沦丧才能扭转。“慢慢地你会认识到：要紧的东西是那些买不到的。”36. [D] 问题为细节理解题，文章第一段the decline in moral standards has at last captured the attention of average Americans 说明Elshtain教授看到美国人开始意识到道德标准的下降而感到高兴。 37. [B] 文章第三段With today's greater mobility and with so many couples working, those bonds have been weakened, replaced by a greater emphasis on self说明美国社会道德下降的原因是因为人们太以自我为中心了，即选项B。 38. [B] 本题为细节判断题。文章第四段the disintergration of traditional communities, in which neighbors looked out for one another，非限制性定语从句解释了传统社区的特点，即邻里之间能相互关照。 39. [A] 本题为细节辨认题。文章倒数第三段unheard of in the 1950s, such as classroom violence说明在20世纪50年代，教室暴力是闻所未闻之事。 40. [D] 本题为细节变向表达。文章最后一段Moral decline will not be reversed until people find ways to counter the materialism in society说明如果想改变目前道德标准下降的状况就应该改变物欲太重的现象，即D。 Part III Vocabulary and Structure 41. [D] by引导时间状语时，句子一般用完成时态，这里by短语所引导的是将来的时间，因此应该用将来完成时，所以答案为D。 42. [A] 本题中所填谓语动词是宾语从句中时间状语从句中的谓语动词，不受前面动词的限制，该用什么时态的就用什么时态。从句表示一般将来，因此应该用一般现在，答案A。 43. [C] 本题为话题同现题，从lawyer的使用可以判断这里所表达的是"案件"，所以答案为C。 44.

Part II 					Reading Comprehension 			(35 minutes) Direction: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center. Passage One Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage: In the 1960s, medical researchers Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe developed a checklist of stressful events. They appreciated the tricky point that any major change can be stressful. Negative events like “serious illness of a family member” were high on the list, but so were some positive life-changing events, like marriage. When you take the Holmes-Rahe test you must remember that the score does not reflect how you deal with stress — it only shows how much you have to deal with. And we now know that the way you handle these events dramatically affects your chances of staying healthy. By the early 1970s, hundreds of similar studies had followed Holmes and Rahe. And millions of Americans who work and live under stress worried over the reports. Somehow, the research got boiled down to a memorable message. Women’s magazines ran headlines like “Stress causes illness!” If you want to stay physically and mentally healthy, the articles said, avoid stressful events. But such simplistic advice is impossible to follow. Even if stressful events are dangerous, many — like the death of a loved one — are impossible to avoid. Moreover, any warning to avoid all stressful events is a prescription (处方) for staying away from opportunities as well as trouble. Since any change can be stressful, a person who wanted to be completely free of stress would never marry, have a child, take a new job or move. The notion that all stress makes you sick also ignores a lot of what we know about people. It assumes we’re all vulnerable (脆弱的) and passive in the face of adversity (逆境). But what about human initiative and creativity? Many come through periods of stress with more physical and mental vigor than they had before. We also know that a long time without change or challenge can lead to boredom, and physical and metal strain. 21. The result of Holmes-Rahe’s medical research tells us __________. A) the way you handle major events may cause stress B) what should be done to avoid stress C) what kind of event would cause stress D) how to cope with sudden changes in life 22. The studies on stress in the early s led to _________. A) widespread concern over its harmful effects B) great panic over the mental disorder it could cause C) an intensive research into stress-related illnesses D) popular avoidance of stressful jobs 23. The score of the Holmes-Rahe test shows ________. A) how much pressure you are under B) how positive events can change your life C) how stressful a major event can be D) how you can deal with life-changing events 24. Why is “such simplistic advice” (Line 1, Para. 3) impossible to follow? A) No one can stay on the same job for long. B) No prescription is effective in relieving stress. C) People have to get married someday. D) You could be missing opportunities as well. 25. According to the passage people who have experienced ups and downs may become ________. A) nervous when faced with difficulties B) physically and mentally strained C) more capable of coping with adversity D) indifferent toward what happens to them Passage Two Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage: Most episodes of absent-mindedness — forgetting where you left something or wondering why you just entered a room — are caused by a simple lack of attention, says Schacter. “You’re supposed to remember something, but you haven’t encoded it deeply.” Encoding, Schacter explains, is a special way of paying attention to an event that has a major impact on recalling it later. Failure to encode properly can create annoying situations. If you put your mobile phone in a pocket, for example, and don’t pay attention to what you did because you’re involved in a conversation, you’ll probably forget that the phone is in the jacket now hanging in you wardrobe (衣柜). “Your memory itself isn’t failing you,” says Schacter. “Rather, you didn’t give your memory system the information it needed.” Lack of interest can also lead to absent-mindedness. “A man who can recite sports statistics from 30 years ago,” says Zelinski, “may not remember to drop a letter in the mailbox.” Women have slightly better memories than men, possibly because they pay more attention to their environment, and memory relies on just that. Visual cues can help prevent absent-mindedness, says Schacter. “But be sure the cue is clear and available,” he cautions. If you want to remember to take a medication (药物) with lunch, put the pill bottle on the kitchen table — don’t leave it in the medicine chest and write yourself a note that you keep in a pocket. Another common episode of absent-mindedness: walking into a room and wondering why you’re there. Most likely, you were thinking about something else. “Everyone does this from time to time,” says Zelinski. The best thing to do is to return to where you were before entering the room, and you’ll likely remember. 26. Why does the author think that encoding properly is very important?

Passage Three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage: It is hard to track the blue whale, the ocean’s largest creature, which has almost been killed off by commercial whaling and is now listed as an endangered species. Attaching radio devices to it is difficult, and visual sightings are too unreliable to give real insight into its behavior. So biologists were delighted early this year when, with the help of the Navy, they were able to track a particular blue whale for 43 days, monitoring its sounds. This was possible because of the Navy’s formerly top-secret system of underwater listening devices spanning the oceans. Tracking whales is but one example of an exciting new world just opening to civilian scientists after the cold war as the Navy starts to share and partly uncover its global network of underwater listening system built over the decades to track the ships of potential enemies. Earth scientists announced at a news conference recently that they had used the system for closely monitoring a deep-sea volcanic eruption (爆发) for the first time and that they plan similar studies. Other scientists have proposed to use the network for tracking ocean currents and measuring changes in ocean and global temperatures. The speed of sound in water is roughly one mile a second — slower than through land but faster than through air. What is most important, different layers of ocean water can act as channels for sounds, focusing them in the same way a stethoscope (听诊器) does when it carries faint noises from a patient’s chest to a doctor’s ear. This focusing is the main reason that even relatively weak sounds in the ocean, especially low-frequency ones, can often travel thousands of miles. 31. The passage is chiefly about ________. A) an effort to protect an endangered marine species B) the civilian use of a military detection system C) the exposure of a U.S. Navy top-secret weapon D) a new way to look into the behavior of blue whales 32. The underwater listening system was originally designed ________. A) to trace and locate enemy vessels B) to monitor deep-sea volcanic eruptions C) to study the movement of ocean currents D) to replace the global radio communications network 33. The deep-sea listening system makes use of ________. A) the sophisticated technology of focusing sounds under water B) the capability of sound to travel at high speed C) the unique property of layers of ocean water in transmitting sound D) low-frequency sounds traveling across different layers of water 34. It can be inferred from the passage that ________. A) new radio devices should be developed for tracking the endangered blue whales B) blue whales are no longer endangered with the use of the new listening system C) opinions differ as to whether civilian scientists should be allowed to use military technology D) military technology has great potential in civilian use 35. Which of the following is true about the U.S. Navy underwater listening network? A) It is now partly accessible to civilian scientists. B) It has been replaced by a more advanced system. C) It became useless to the military after the cold war. D) It is indispensable in protecting endangered species. Passage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage: The fitness movement that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s centered around aerobic exercise (有氧操). Millions of individuals became engaged in a variety of aerobic activities, and literally thousands of health spas developed around the country to capitalize (获利) on this emerging interest in fitness, particularly aerobic dancing for females. A number of fitness spas existed prior to this aerobic fitness movement, even a national chain with spas in most major cities. However, their focus was not on aerobics, but rather on weight-training programs designed to develop muscular mass, strength, and endurance in their primarily male enthusiasts. These fitness spas did not seem to benefit financially form the aerobic fitness movement to better health, since medical opinion suggested that weight-training programs offered few, if any, health benefits. In recent years, however, weight training has again become increasingly popular for males and for females. Many current programs focus not only on developing muscular strength and endurance but on aerobic fitness as well. Historically, most physical-fitness tests have usually included measures of muscular strength and endurance, not for health-related reasons, but primarily because such fitness components have been related to performance in athletics. However, in recent years, evidence has shown that training programs designed primarily to improve muscular strength and endurance might also offer some health benefits as well. The  of Sports Medicine now recommends that weight training be part of a total fitness program for healthy Americans. Increased participation in such training is one of the specific physical activity and fitness objectives of Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives. 36. The word “spas” (Line 3, Para. 1) most probably refers to _________. A) sports activities B) places for physical exercise C) recreation centers D) athletic training programs 37. Early fitness spas were intended mainly for __________. A) the promotion of aerobic exercise B) endurance and muscular development C) the improvement of women’s figures D) better performance in aerobic dancing 38. What was the attitude of doctors towards weight training in health improvement? A) Positive. B) Indifferent. C) Negative. D) Cautious. 39. People were given physical fitness tests in order to find out ________. A) how ell they could do in athletics B) what their health condition was like C) what kind of fitness center was suitable for them D) whether they were fit for aerobic exercise 40. Recent studies have suggested that weight training __________. A) has become an essential part of people’s life B) may well affect the health of the trainees C) will attract more people in the days to come D) contributes to health improvement as well Part III						Vocabulary and Structure 				(20 minutes) Directions: There are 3.0. incomplete sentences in this part.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words (not exceeding 10 words). As researchers learn more about how children's intelligence develops, they are increasingly surprised by the power of parents. The power of the school has been replaced by the home. To begin with, all the factors which are part of intelligence — the child's understanding of language, learning patterns, curiosity — are established well before the child enters school at the age of six. Study after study has shown that even after school begins, children's achievements have been far more influenced by parents than by teachers. This is particularly true about learning that is language- related. The school rather than the home is given credit for variations in achievement in subjects such as science. In view of their power, it's sad to see so many parents not making the most of their child's intelligence. Until recently parents had been warned by educators who asked them not to educate their children. Many teachers now realize that children cannot be educated only at school and parents are being asked to contribute both before and after the child enters school. Parents have been particularly afraid to teach reading at home. Of course, children shouldn't be pushed to read by their parents, but educators have discovered that reading is best taught individually — and the easiest place to do this is at home. Many four-and five-year-olds who have been shown a few letters and taught their sounds will compose single words of their own with them even before they have been taught to read.

D Passage One 译文	在20世纪60年代，医学研究人员Thomas Holmes 和Richrd Rahe 对造成压力的事情整理出了一份清单。他们欣赏这一令人迷惑的观点：任何大的改变都会带来压力。类似于“家庭成员患严重疾病”等具有消极影响的事情高居榜首，但像“结婚”等具有积极意义的转折性事情也榜上有名。当你接受Holmes-Rahe测试时你必须牢记：分数并不反映你如何处理压力，而只是反映你必须处理的程度。我们现在知道，处理这些事件的方式在很大程度上能影响你保持健康的可能性。	在20世纪70年代初期，数百项类似的研究继Holmes 和Rahe之后展开。几百万在压力下生活工作的美国人对研究报告非常担心。不知是什么原因，这项研究被归结为难忘的启示。例如，妇女杂志登出大标题：压力导致疾病！文章说，如果你想保持身心健康，就必须避免造成压的事情。	但是采纳这种过分简单化的建议是不可能的。尽管造成压力的事情对健康有害，比如说至爱亲朋的死亡，但许多是无法避免的。而且，任何能够避开所有压力的警告其实都是避开麻烦也失去机会的处方。既然任何改变都会带来压力，那么一个想完全摆脱压力的人就得永远也不结婚、不生子、不选择新的工作或不搬家了。	压力会使人生病的观念也忽视了我们对人的许多了解。它认为面对逆境都是脆弱和被动的。那么如何看待人的主动性和创造力呢？经过压力后许多人无论在体力还是在精神上都比过去更有活力。同时，我们也知道：长期没有任何变化或挑战的生活可能会导致乏味和身心疲劳。Passage Two 译文	Schacter 解释说，大部分心不在焉都是因精力不集中造成的，如记不清把东西放在哪里，或者进了房间却忘了想干什么等等。“你本应该记住某事，但并没有把它认真编码”。	Schacte解释说，编码是集中注意力于某一件事的特殊方式，它对于以后回忆有重要影响。不恰当地编码会造成令人非常烦心的状况。比如说你把手机放在上衣口袋里，但因为你正在谈话，所以并没有注意到这一动作，很可能忘记了手机在衣橱里的茄克衫呢。Schacte说：“你的记忆力本身没有问题而是你没有给记忆系统提供它所需的信息。”	另外，缺乏兴趣也会导致心不在焉。Zelinski说：“一个能背诵三十年前的体育统计数据的人，很可能会记不住要把信息投进邮筒。”女性的记忆力略强于男性，很可能是因为女性更注意周围环境，而这正是记忆所依赖的。	Schacter说，视觉提示可以帮助避免心不在焉。他提醒说：“但要保证是清楚且能看到的提示。”如果你想记住吃午饭时服药，就把药瓶放在餐桌上，千万别把药瓶放在药柜里，然后再写一张纸条放在衣兜里。	另一种心不在焉的现象是进了房间却忘了想干什么。极有可能你正在想别的事情。Zelinski说：“每个人都常会有这种情况。”最好的办法是返回到你进房间以前的地方，这样你很可能就会想起来了。	Passage Three 译文	现在已经很难找到海洋中最大的动物蓝鲸的踪迹了。商业捕鲸几乎将它们灭杀殆尽，因而现在蓝鲸被列为濒危动物类。很难为蓝鲸安装无线电装置，而肉眼观测不可靠，不能对蓝鲸的行为进行仔细观察。	今年早些时候，生物学家们非常高兴。因为在海军的帮助下，通过监测蓝鲸的声音，他们能够跟踪一条蓝鲸长达四十三天。这之所以可能，是因为海军从前绝密的海底监听系统横跨了海洋。	冷战结束后，海军对几十年来为跟踪潜在敌舰而建立的全球海底监听系统作了部分解密，并开始同他人分享。追踪蓝鲸只不过是令人激动的新世界向民用科学家开放的一个例子。	在最近的记者招待会上地球科学家宣布：他们首次利用这一系统对深海火山爆发进行了仔细的观测并计划做类似的研究。	另一些科学家建议利用这一网络跟踪洋流、预测海洋变化和全球温度。	声音在水中的传播速度大约是每秒一英里，比在陆地中的传播速度慢，但比在空气中要快。最为重要的是，不同层面的海水都可以成为声道，如同听诊器一样把声音汇聚在一起，把病人胸腔的微弱的声音传到医生的耳机里。声音的这种汇聚就可以解释为什么在海洋里，即使是相对微弱的声音（特别是低频声音）也可以传播几千英里了。	Passage Four 译文	起源于20世纪60年代后期至70年代早期的健身运动主要是增氧锻炼。数百万人参加各种增氧锻炼，为了利用人们对这种新出现的健身运动的兴趣，尤其是女子对有氧健美操的兴趣，确实有数千家健身中心在全国出现。很多健身中心在增氧健身运动兴起前就出现了，甚至在大多数大城市出现了全国连锁健身中心。但是它们的重点不在于有氧运动，而在于举重，这些活动主要是对加强肌肉健美、增强体质、提高耐力的男性爱好者而设计的。这些健身中心似乎并没有从促进健康的增氧运动活动中获得经济利益，因为当时医学上的看法是：举重对健康几乎没有什么促进作用，即使有也是微乎其微。但是最近几年来，健美训练在男男女女中又越来越流行起来。目前许多项目的重点不光是锻炼肌肉和耐力，还将重点放在增氧健身上。	历史上，绝大多数体能测试通常包括肌肉力量和耐力，这并不是为了健康，而主要是因为这些健康指标与体育成绩有关。但是最近有证据表明：主要是为强健肌肉力量和加强耐力而设计的训练项目对人体健康也有益。美国体育运动医学院建议，举重训练应当成为健康美国人健身项目的一部分。2000年越来越多的人参加这种训练，这是2000全民健康年——促进全民健康、实现预防疾病目标——这个特定体育活动和健身目标之一。Part Ⅲ Vocabulary and Structure41.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:　　 On average, American kids ages 3 to 12 spent 29 hours a week in school, eight hours more than they did in 1981. They also did more household work and participated in more of such organized activities as soccer and ballet (芭蕾舞). Involvement in sports, in particular, rose almost 50% from 1981 to 1997: boys now spend an average of four hours a week playing sports; girls log half that time. All in all, however, children’s leisure time dropped from 40% of the day in 1981 to 25%.
　　 “Children are affected by the same time crunch (危机) that affects their parents,” says Sandra Hofferth, who headed the recent study of children’s timetable. A chief reason, she says, is that more mothers are working outside the home. (Nevertheless, children in both double-income and “male breadwinner” households spent comparable mounts of time interacting with their parents, 19 hours and 22 hours respectively. In contrast, children spent only 9 hours with their single mothers.)　　 All work and no play could make for some very messed-up kids. “Play is the most powerful way a child explores the world and learns about himself,” says T. Berry Brazelton, professor at . Unstructured play encourages independent thinking and allows the young to negotiate their relationships with their peers, but kids ages 3 to 12 spent only 12 hours a week engaged in it.　　 The children sampled spent a quarter of their rapidly decreasing “free time” watching television. But that, believe it or not, was one of the findings parents might regard as good news. If they’re spending less time in front of the TV set, however, kids aren’t replacing it with reading. Despite efforts to get kids more interested in books, the children spent just over an hour a week reading. Let’s face it, who’s got the time?21. By mentioning “the same time crunch” (Line 1, Para. 2) Sandra Hofferth means ________.　　 A) children have little time to play with their parents　　 B) children are not taken good care of by their working parents　　 C) both parents and children suffer from lack of leisure time　　 D) both parents and children have trouble managing their time22. According to the author, the reason given by Sandra Hofferth for the time crunch is______.　　 A) quite convincing　　 B) partially true　　 C) totally groundless　　 D) rather confusing23. According to the author a child develops better if ______.　　 A) he has plenty of time reading and studying　　 B) he is left to play with his peers in his own way　　 C) he has more time participating in school activities　　 D) he is free to interact with his working parents24. The author is concerned about the fact that American kids ______.　　 A) are engaged in more and more structured activities　　 B) are increasingly neglected by their working mothers　　 C) are spending more and more time watching TV　　 D) are involved less and less in household work
25. We can infer from the passage that ______.　　 A) extracurricular activities promote children’s intelligence　　 B) most children will turn to reading with TV sets switched off　　 C) efforts to get kids interested in reading have been fruitful　　 D) most parents believe reading to be beneficial to childrenPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:　　 Henry Ford, the famous  inventor and car manufacturer, once said, ‘The business of  is business.” By this he meant that the  way of life is based on the values of the business world.　　 Few would argue with Ford’s statement. A brief glimpse at a daily newspaper vividly shows how much people in the  think about business. For example, nearly every newspaper has a business section, in which the deals and projects, finances and management, stock prices and labor problems of corporations are reported daily. In addition, business news can appear in every other section. Most national news has an important financial aspect to it. Welfare, foreign aid, the federal budget, and the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank are all heavily affected by business. Moreover, business news appears in some of the unlikeliest places. The world of arts and entertainment is often referred to as “the entertainment industry” or “show business.”　　 The positive side of Henry Ford’s statement can be seen in the prosperity that business has brought to  life. One of the most important reasons so many people from all over the world come to live in the  is the dream of a better job. Jobs are produced in abundance (大量地) because the U.S. economic system is driven by competition. People believe that this system creates more wealth, more jobs, and a materially better way of life.　　 The negative side of Henry Ford’s statement, however, can be seen when the word business is taken to mean big business. And the term big business—referring to the biggest companies, is seen in opposition to labor. Throughout  history working people have had to fight hard for higher wages, better working conditions, and the right to form unions. Today, many of the old labor disputes are over, but there is still some employee anxiety. Downsizing—the laying off of thousands of workers to keep expenses low and profits high -- creates feelings of insecurity for many.26. The  is a typical country ______.　 	A) which encourages free trade at homes and abroad　 	B) where people’s chief concern is how to make money　 	C) where all businesses are managed scientifically　 	D) which normally works according to the federal budget27. The influence of business in the  is evidenced by the fact that ______.　 	A) most newspapers are run by big businesses　 	B) even public organizations concentrate on working for profits　 	C) Americans of all professions know how to do business　 	D) even arts and entertainment are regarded as business28. According to the passage, immigrants choose to settle in the , dreaming that ______.　 	A) they can start profitable businesses there　	B) they can be more competitive in business　 	C) they will make a fortune overnight there　 	D) they will find better chances of employment29. Henry Ford’s statements can be taken negatively because ______.　 	A) working people are discouraged to fight for their rights　 	B) there are many industries controlled by a few big capitalists　 	C) there is a conflicting relationship between big corporations and labor　 	D) public services are not run by the federal government30. A company’s efforts to keep expenses low and profits high may result in ______.
　　A) reduction in the number of employees　　B) improvement of working conditions　　C) fewer disputes between labor and management	D) a rise in workers’ wagesPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:　　 Professor Smith recently persuaded 35 people, 23 of them women, to keep a diary of all their absent-minded actions for a fortnight. When he came to analyse their embarrassing lapses (差错) in a scientific report, he was surprised to find that nearly all of them fell into a few groupings. Nor did the lapses appear to be entirely random (随机的).
　　 One of the women, for instance, on leaving her house for work one morning threw her dog her earrings and tried to fix a dog biscuit on her ear. “The explanation for this is that the brain is like a computer,” explains the professor. “People programme themselves to do certain activities regularly. It was the woman’s custom every morning to throw her dog two biscuits and then put on her earrings. But somehow the action got reversed in the programme.” About one in twenty of the incidents the volunteers reported were these “programme assembly failures.”
　　 Altogether the volunteers logged 433 unintentional actions that they found themselves doing – an average of twelve each. There appear to be peak periods in the day when we are at our zaniest (荒谬可笑的). These are two hours some time between eight a.m. and noon, between four and six p.m. with a smaller peak between eight and ten p.m. “Among men the peak seems to be when a changeover in brain ‘programmes’ occurs, as for instance between going to and from work.” Women on average reported slightly more lapses – 12.5 compared with 10.9 for men – probably because they were more reliable reporters.
　　 A startling finding of the research is that the absent-minded activity is a hazard of doing things in which we are skilled. Normally, you would expect that skill reduces the number of errors we make. But trying to avoid silly slips by concentrating more could make things a lot worse – even dangerous.31. In his study Professor Smith asked the subjects ______.　　 A) to keep track of people who tend to forget things　　 B) to report their embarrassing lapses at random　　 C) to analyse their awkward experiences scientifically　　 D) to keep a record of what they did unintentionally32. Professor Smith discovered that ______.　　 A) certain patterns can be identified in the recorded incidents　　 B) many people were too embarrassed to admit their absent-mindedness　　 C) men tend to be more absent-minded than women　　 D) absent-mindedness is an excusable human weakness33. “Programme assembly failures” (Line 6, Para.2) refers to the phenomenon that people ______.　　 A) often fail to programme their routines beforehand　　 B) tend to make mistakes when they are in a hurry　　 C) unconsciously change the sequence of doing things　　 D) are likely to mess things up if they are too tired34. We learn from the third paragraph that ______.　　 A) absent-mindedness tends to occur during certain hours of the day　　 B) women are very careful to perform actions during peak periods　　 C) women experience more peak periods of absent-mindedness　　 D) men’s absent-mindedness often results in funny situations35. It can be concluded from the passage that ______.　　 A) people should avoid doing important things during peak periods of lapses　　 B) hazards can be avoided when people do things they are good at　　 C) people should be careful when programming their actions　　 D) lapses cannot always be attributed to lack of concentrationPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:　　 It’s no secret that many children would be healthier and happier with adoptive parents than with the parents that nature dealt them. That’s especially true of children who remain in abusive homes bemuse the law blindly favors biological parents. It’s also true of children who suffer for years in foster homes (收养孩子的家庭) because of parents who can’t or won’t care for them but refuse to give up custody (监护) rights.　　 Fourteen-year-old Kimberly Mays fits neither description, but her recent court victory could eventually help children who do. Kimberly has been the object of an angry custody battle between the man who raised her and her biological parents, with whom she has never lived. A  judge ruled that the teenager can remain with the only father she’s ever known and that her biological parents have “no legal claim” on her.　　 The ruling, though it may yet be reversed, sets aside the principle that biology is the primary determinant of parentage. That’s an important development, one that’s long overdue.　　 Shortly after birth in December 1978, Kimberly Mays and another infant were mistakenly switched and sent home with the wrong parents. Kimberly’s biological parents, Ernest and Regina Twigg, received a child who died of a heart disease in 1988. Medical tests showed that the child wasn’t the Twiggs’ own daughter, but Kimberly was, thus sparking a custody battle with Robert Mays. In 1989, the two families agreed that Mr. Mays would maintain custody with the Twiggs getting visiting rights. Those rights were ended when Mr. Mays decided that Kimberly was being harmed.　　 The decision to leave Kimberly with Mr. Mays rendered her suit debated. But the judge made clear that Kimberly did have standing to sue (起诉) on her own behalf. Thus he made clear that she was more than just property to be handled as adults saw fit.　　 Certainly, the biological link between parent and child is fundamental. But biological parents aren’t always preferable to adoptive ones, and biological parentage does not convey an absolute ownership that cancels all the rights of children.36. What was the primary consideration in the  judge’s ruling?　　 A) The biological link.　　 B) The child’s benefits.　　 C) The traditional practice.　　 D) The parents’ feelings.37. We can learn from the Kimberly case that ______.　　 A) children are more than just personal possessions of their parents　　 B) the biological link between parents and child should be emphasized　　 C) foster homes bring children more pain and suffering than care　　 D) biological parents shouldn’t claim custody rights after their child is adopted38. The Twiggs claimed custody rights to Kimberly because ______.　　 A) they found her unhappy in Mr. Mays’ custody　　 B) they regarded her as their property　　 C) they were her biological parents　　 D) they felt guilty about their past mistake39. Kimberly had been given to Mr. Mays ________.　　 A) by sheer accident　　 B) out of charity　　 C) at his request　　 D) for better care40. The author’s attitude towards the judge’s ruling could be described as ______.　　 A) doubtful　　 B) critical　　 C) cautious　　 D) supportivePart III 				Vocabulary and Structure 					(20 minutes)Directions: There are 3.0. incomplete sentences in this part.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Write your answers in the spaces provided on the right of the page.
　　 What personal qualities are desirable in a teacher? I think the following would be generally accepted.
　　 First, the teacher’s personality should be lively and attractive. This does not rule out people who are plain-looking, or even ugly, because many such people have great personal charm. But it does rule out such types as the over-excitable, sad, cold, and frustrated.
　　 Secondly, it is not merely desirable but essential for a teacher to have a genuine capacity for sympathy, a capacity to understand the minds and feelings of other people, especially, since most teachers are school teachers, the minds and feelings of children. Closely related with this is the capacity to be tolerant – not, indeed, of what is wrong, but of the weaknesses and immaturity of human nature which induce (诱导) people, and again especially children, to make mistakes.
　　 Thirdly, I hold it essential for a teacher to be both intellectually and morally honest. This means that he will be aware of his intellectual strengths and limitations, and will have thought about and decided upon the moral principles by which his life shall be guided. There is no contradiction in my going on to say that a teacher should be a bit of an actor. That is part of the technique of teaching, which demands that every now and then a teacher should be able to put on an act – to enliven (使生动) a lesson, correct a fault, or award praise. Children, especially young children, live in a world that is rather larger than life.
　　 A teacher must be capable of infinite patience. This, I may say, is largely a matter of self-discipline and self-training, for we are none of us born like that.
　　 Finally, I think a teacher should have the kind of mind which always wants to go on learning. Teaching is a job at which one will never be perfect; there is always something more to learn about it. There are three principal objects of study: the subjects which the teacher is teaching; the methods by which the subjects can best be taught to the particular pupils in the classes he is teaching; and g by far the most important -- the children, young people, or adults to whom the subjects are to be taught. The two fundamental principles of British education today are that education is education of the whole person, and that it is best acquired through full and active co-operation between two persons, the teacher and the learner.S1. Plain-looking teachers can also be admired by their students if they have _________.　　 __________________________________________________________________S2. The author says it is _________that teachers be sympathetic with their students.	__________________________________________________________________S3. A teacher should be tolerant because humans tend to have S3 (1) _________and to be S3(2) _________.　　 (1)________________________________________________________________　　 (2)________________________________________________________________S4. A teacher who is _________will be able to make his lessons more lively.　　 __________________________________________________________________S5. How can a teacher acquire infinite patience?　　 __________________________________________________________________S6. Since teaching is a job no one can be perfect at, it is necessary for teachers to keep improving their knowledge of the subjects they teach and their _________.　　 __________________________________________________________________S7. Teachers’ most important object of study is _________.　　 __________________________________________________________________S8. Education cannot be best acquired without _________ between the teacher and the learner.　　 __________________________________________________________________Part V 						Writing 						(30 minutes)Directions: For this part, you are allowed thirty minutes to write an eye-witness account of a traffic accident. You should write at least 120 words according to the outline given below in Chinese.　　 假设你在某日某时目击一起车祸，就此写一份见证书。见证书须包括以下几点：
　　 1. 车祸发生的时间及地点
　　 2. 你所见到的车祸情况
　　 3. 你对车祸原因的分析　　An Eye-Witness Account of a Traffic Accident2003年6月四级试题详解（10）2003年6月四级试题译文Passage One 译文	美国3~12岁的孩子平均每星期的在校时间为29小时，比1981年多了8小时。同时，他们做家务活多了，并且参加更多的像足球、芭蕾舞等有组织的活动。特别是参与体育活动的时间，从1981年到1997年增长了50%：现在男孩子平均每周花4小时运动，女孩的运动时间是男孩的一半。但是，总的说来，孩子们的空闲时间从1981年的40%降到25%。	“影响父母的时间危机同样也影响着孩子们，”最近对儿童作息时间表做调研的项目负责人Sandra Hofferth 如是说。她说一个最主要的原因是更多的母亲外出工作。当然，生活在双收家庭或“父亲挣钱养家型”的家庭的孩子有较多的时间与他们的父母沟通。分别是每周19或22个小时。相反，生活在单身母亲家庭的孩子每周与母亲在一起的时间只有9小时。	如果一味地学习，而没有玩耍会使孩子们的生活变得一团糟。哈佛学院的教授T·Berry Brazelton说：“玩耍是孩子们探索世界和认识自我的最有效的途径”。自由的玩耍促使孩子们独立地思考，并使他们与同伴协调地相处，然而，3~12岁的孩子花在玩耍的时间每周只有12个小时。	抽样的调查显示，孩子们把已经快速减少的“自由时间”的四分之一用于看电视。但是，不管你相信不相信，家用长们对这样的结果还是庆幸的。即使孩子们不花更多的时间看电视，他们也不会把时间用在读书上。尽管家长们费尽心思让孩子们对书本感兴趣，但是，他们每周花在阅读上的时间也只有一个多小时。让我们面对现实吧，谁有时间呢？`Passage Two 译文	美国最著名的发明家和汽车制造商亨利·福特曾经说：“美国的一切都是商业”。此话的意思是说，美国人的生活方式建立在商品社会的价值观上。	很少有人对福特的说法提出疑义。只在一张日报上瞥一眼，就不难发现有多少美国在关心商业。比如，几乎每家报纸都有商业版，对各种工程项目、资金和管理、股票价格和公司的劳动问题都是每日一报。此外，商业信息还在其他版面中出现。大多数国内新闻都反映重要的金融信息。福利、援外、联邦财政预算以及联邦储备银行的政策都极大地受到商业的影响。而且，商业信息还会在一些最不可能的地主出现。艺术和娱乐界经常被称为“娱乐业”或“演艺业”。	福特说法积极的一面可以从商业给美国生活带来的繁荣中看到。之所以有如此众多的人从世界各地蜂拥而至美国，其最重要的原因之一就是实现找到一份更好的工作梦想。工作的机会很多，因为美国的经济制度是由竞争驱动的。人们相信这样的制度能创造更多的财富，提供更好的工作和更好的物质生活。	但是，福特的说法中消极的一面也显而易见，即当商业这个词用来指代大财团的时候。‘大财团’这个词——指代是与工人相对的最大的商业集团或公司。在美国的历史上，工人们曾经为争取更高的工资、更好的工作环境以及组织工会的权利而艰苦地斗争。今天，许多旧的劳资纠纷已经消失，但是，雇员们仍然存在着忧虑。裁员——解雇成千上万的工人以保证成本和高效益——使很多人产生不安全感。Passage Three 译文	史密斯教授最近说服了35个人，其中有23位妇女，坚持记两周日记，把他们所有心不在焉的行为都记下来。当他在一份科研报告中分析这些令人尴尬的差错时，他惊奇地发现几乎所有的差错都可以归入几类。这些差错并不是毫无规律的。例如，其中的一位妇女，早晨离家上班的时候，把她的耳环扔给了她的狗，却试图把宠物饼干戴在耳朵上。“对这种行为的解释是，大脑就像是计算机”，教授说。“人们为自己设定好了程序去做一些经常性的事务。对这位妇女来说，扔给她的狗两块饼干，然后戴上耳环是每天早晨的习惯。但是，有时候程序中的步骤颠倒了。”报告中受试者的差错约有二十分之一属于“此类程序排列错误”。	受试者共记录了433件他们自己认为是无意识的而做的事情——平均每人十二件。研究发现人们在一天中的高峰时段经常会做出荒谬可笑的事情。一天中共有两个小时这样的时间，分别出现在早晨8点到中午，下午4点到6点之间，晚上8点到10点之间有个小高峰。“对男人来说，高峰时段出现在大脑‘程序’需要切换的时候，比如，上下班的时候”。报告还称，平均而言，妇女的差错更高一些——男女之比为12.5:10.9——这也许是因为女性是更可靠记录者。	此项研究一个惊人的发现是心不在焉的行为原来是我们在做熟练之事时所犯的。一般来说，人们希望熟练能减少我们所犯的错误。但是，通过集中注意力避免愚蠢的失误会使事情更糟——甚至更危险。	Passage Four 译文	很多孩子在养父母家比在亲生父母家过得更健康、更快乐，这已经不是秘密了。对于那些由于法律盲目偏袒生物学意义上的父母而留在那些受虐待的家庭的孩子来说尤其如此。同时，对那些由于父母没有能力或不愿意照顾他们，但又不肯放弃监护权而痛苦地生活在收养家庭的孩子来说也是如此。	十四岁的Kimberly Mays 不属于上述情况，但是，她最近的一场官司的打赢最终于可以帮助那些有相同的情况的孩子。Kimberly 一直是一场愤怒的监护权争夺战中的争夺对象，一方是他的养父，另一方是她从来没有与之生活在一起的亲生父母。佛罗里达州的法官做出裁定，该少年应继续与她惟一熟悉的养父生活在一起，她的亲生父母“在法律上没有权利主张”得到她。	这个裁定尽管有可能是本末倒置，但它驳回了血缘是决定父母身份的这一准则。这是一个重要进步，是一个人们期待已久的进步。	1978年12月，Kimberly Mays 刚出生就与另一个孩子被弄混而抱错到了不是亲生的父母家中。Kimberly 的亲生父母Ernest and Regina Twigg收养的孩子于1988年死于心脏病。医学检查显示孩子不是Twigg家的女儿，而Kimberly 却是，于是，引发了Twigg家与Robert Mays 争夺监护权的官司。1989年，两家同意Mays 先生保留监护权，Twigg夫妇有权探望。后来Mays 先生认为Kimberly 受到了伤害，探视权被终止。	把Kimberly 判给Mays 先生使此案引起了争议。但是，法官表示Kimberly 有权以自己的名义起诉。于是，他表明了她并不是一件可以以成年人认为合适的方式被处理的商品。	当然，父母与孩子的血缘关系是基本的。但是，亲生父母并非一定比养父母好，同时，血缘上的父母身份不能拥有取消孩子一切权利的绝对所有权。Part IV Short Questions 译文什么是教师优良的个人品格？我认为一般有下列几点：教师的个人品格应该活泼而可爱。这并不排斥长相一般，甚至难看的人，因为很多这样的人具有巨大的个人魅力。但比如过激的、悲观的、冷漠的和灰心的人则不宜当教师。一个教师不仅需要而且必须具备真正的同情心，即具备理解他人思想和感情的能力，尤其是儿童的思想和感情，因为大部分教师是中小学老师。与此密切相关的是要具有宽容心，当然不是宽容错误，而是宽容那些诱使人们尤其是儿童犯错误的人性的幼稚和弱点。我认为一个教师必须对知识和道德都要采取诚实的态度。也就是说，他要对自己的智力上的长处和不足有一个清醒的认识，而且还要根据他在生活中遵循道德原则进行思考和决策。这和我即将在下面谈到教师要会一点表演艺术并不矛盾。那是教学技能的一部分，它要求一个教师随时随地都能进行表演——生动形象地讲课、纠错或表扬。儿童，尤其是幼儿应该生活在比生活更宽广的世界。一个教师应该具有极大的忍耐性。我认为这主要是个自我约束和自我培养的问题，因为我们谁也不是生来就会的。最后，我想一个教师应该具有一种孜孜不倦的学习精神。教书是一个学无止境的职业，总有更多的东西等待着我们去学习。有三门主课要学：正在施教的课目；对所教班级中的特别生最佳的施教方法；施教对象显然是最重要的，无论儿童、青年还是成年人。今日英国的教育有两个基本原则：教育是对人的全面教育；通过教学双方充分、主动的合作实现最好地习得。2003年9月四级试题Part I　　　　　 　  Listening Comprehension　　　　　(20 minutes) Section A Directions: In this section, you will hear 10 short conversations.

A rectal study, published in last week’s Journal of the American Medical Association, offers a picture of how risky it is to get a lift from a teenage driver, Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a fatal accident as a teenager driving alone, By contrast, the risk of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional passenger. The author also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased dramatically after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight, With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late-night accident. Robert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with “really stupid behavior” than with just a lack of driving experience. “The basic issue.” Be says, “is that adults who are responsible for issuing licenses fail to recognize how complex and skilled a task driving is.” Both he and the author of the study believe that the way to mitigate (使…缓解)the problem is to have states institute so-called graduated licensing systems, in which getting a license is a multistage process. A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove himself capable of driving in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with night of massager restrictions, before graduating to full driving privileges. Graduated licensing systems have reduced teenage driver crashes, according to recent studies, About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place, but only 10 of those states have restrictions on passengers, California is the strictest, with a novice (新手) driver prohibited from carrying any passenger under 20(without the presence of an adult over 25)for the first six months. 21. Which of the following situations is most dangerous according to the passage? A) Adults giving a lift to teenagers on the highway after 10 p.m. B) A teenager driving after midnight with passengers in the car. C) Adults driving with three or more teenage passengers late at night. D) A teenager getting a lift from a stranger on the highway at midnight. 22. According to Robert Foss. The high death rate of teenage drivers is mainly due to ______.A) their frequent driving at nightB) their improper way of drivingC) their lack of driving experience D) their driving with passengers 23. According to Paragraph 3. which of the following statements is TRUE? A) Teenagers should spend more time learning to drive. B) Driving is a skill too complicated for teenagers to learn. C) Restrictions should be imposed on teenagers applying to take driving lessons. D) The licensing authorities are partly responsible for teenagers' driving accidents. 24. A suggested measure to be taken to reduce teenagers' driving accidents is that ________ . A) driving in the presence of an adult should be made a rule B) they should be prohibited from taking on passengers C) they should not be allowed to drive after 10 p.m. D) the licensing system should be improved 25. The present situation in about half of the states is that the graduated licensing system ________. A) is under discussion B) is about to be set up C) has been put into effect D) has been perfected Passage Two Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage. If you know exactly what you want, the best route to a job is to get specialized training. A recent survey shows that companies the graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training. That's especially true of booing fields that are challenging for workers. At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five jobs offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement. Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience. But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off. Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval. The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, but the impact of a degree washes out after five years. As further evidence of the erosion (销蚀) of corporate (公司的) faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State’s Scheetz cites a pattern in corporate hiring practices, Although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management. “They want someone who isn’t constrained (限制) by nuts and bolts to look at the big picture,”says Scheetz. This sounds suspiciously like a formal statement that you approve of the liberal-arts graduate. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems, David Birch claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, “I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things,” says Birch. Liberal-arts means an academically thorough and strict program that includes literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior—plus a computer course or two. With that under your belt, you can feel free to specialize, “A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace,” says Scheetz. 26. What kinds of people are in high demand on the job market? A) Students with a bachelor's degree in humanities. B) People with an MBA degree front top universities. C) People with formal schooling plus work experience. D) People with special training in engineering 27. By saying “…but the impact of a degree washes out after five years” (Line 3, , 3), the author means ________. A) most MBA programs fail to provide students with a solid foundation B) an MBA degree does not help promotion to managerial positions C) MBA programs will not be as popular in five years' time as they are now D) in five people will forget about the degree the MBA graduates have got 28. According to Scheetz's statement (Lines 4-5. . 4), companies prefer ________. A) people who have a strategic mind B) people who are talented in fine arts C) people who are ambitious and aggressive D) people who have received training in mechanics 29. David Birch claims that he only hires liberal-arts people because ________. A) they are more capable of handling changing situations B) they can stick to established ways of solving problems C) they are thoroughly trained in a variety of specialized fields D) they have attended special programs in management 30. Which of the following statements does the author support? A) Specialists are more expensive to hire than generalists. B) Formal schooling is less important than job training. C) On-the-job training is, in the long run, less costly. D) Generalists will outdo specialists in management. Passage Three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage. About six years ago I was eating lunch in a restaurant in  when a woman and a young boy sat down at the next table, I couldn’t help overhearing parts of their conversation. At one point the woman asked: "So, how have you been?" And the boy—who could not have been more than seven or eight years old —replied. "Frankly, I've been feeling a little depressed lately.'' This incident stuck in my mind because it confirmed my growing belief that children are changing. As far as I can remember, my friends and I didn’t find out we were “depressed” until we were in high school. The evidence of a change in children has increased steadily in recent years. Children don’t seem childlike anymore. Children speak more like adults, dress more like adults and behave more like adults than they used to. Whether this is good or bad is difficult to say, but it certainly is different. Childhood as it once was no longer exists, Why? Human development is based not only on innate (天生的) biological states, but also on patterns of access to social knowledge. Movement from one social role to another usually involves learning the secrets of the new status. Children have always been taught adult secrets, but slowly and in stages: traditionally, we tell sixth graders things we keep hidden from fifth graders. In the last 30 years. however, a secret-revelation (揭示) machine has been installed in 98 percent of American homes. It is called television, Television passes information, and indiscriminately (不加区分地), to all viewers alike, be they children or adults. Unable to resist the temptation, many children turn their attention from printed texts to the less challenging, more vivid moving pictures. Communication through print, as a matter of fact, allows for a great deal of control over the social information to which children have access.  and writing involve a complex code of symbols that must be memorized and practices. Children must read simple books before they can read complex materials. 31. According to the author, feeling depressed is ________. A) a sure sign of a psychological problem in a child B) something hardly to be expected in a young child C) an inevitable has of children's mental development D) a mental scale present in all humans, including children 32. Traditionally, a child is supposed to learn about the adult world ________. A) through contact with society B) gradually and under guidanceC) naturally and by biological instinct D)through exposure to social information 33. The phenomenon that today’s children seem adultlike is attributed by the author to ________. A) the widespread influence of television B) the poor arrangement of teaching content C) the fast pace of human intellectual development D) the constantly rising standard of living 34. Why is the author in favor of communication through print for children? A) It enables children to gain more social information. B) It develops children's interest in reading and writing. C) It helps children to memorize and practice more. D) It can control what children are to learn. 35. What does the author think of the change in today’s children? A) He feels amused by chair premature behavior. B) He thinks it is a phenomenon worthy of note. C) He considers it a positive development. D) He seems to be upset about it. Passage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage. "Opinion" is a word that is used carelessly today. It is used to refer to matters of taste, belief, and judgment. This casual use would probably cause little confusion if people didn’t attach too much importance to opinion. Unfortunately, most to attach great importance to it. "I have as much right to my opinion as you to yours, '' and ''Everyone’s entitled to his opinion, '' are common expressions. In fact, anyone who would challenge another's opinion is likely to be branded intolerant. Is that label accurate? Is it intolerant to challenge another's opinion? It depends on what definition of opinion you have in mind. For example, you may ask a friend, “What do you think of the new Ford cars?” And he may reply, "In my opinion, they're ugly." In this case, it would not only be intolerant to challenge his statement, but foolish. For it's obvious that by opinion he means his personal preference, a matter of taste. And as the old saying goes, ''It's pointless to argue about matters of taste." But consider this very different use of the term, a newspaper reports that the Supreme Court has delivered its opinion in a controversial case. Obviously the justices did not shale their personal preferences, their mere likes and dislikes, they stated their considered judgment, painstakingly arrived at after thorough inquiry and deliberation. Most of what is referred to as opinion falls somewhere between these two extremes. It is not an expression of taste. Nor is it careful judgment. Yet it may contain elements of both. It is a view or belief more or less casually arrived at, with or without examining the evidence. Is everyone entitled to his opinion? Of course, this is not only permitted, but guaranteed. We are free to act on our opinions only so long as, in doing so, we do not harm others. 36. Which of the following statements is TRUE, according to the author? A) Everyone has a right to hold his own opinion. B) Free expression of opinions often leads to confusion. C) Most people tend to be careless in forming their opinions. D) Casual use of the word "opinion" often brings about quarrels. 37. According to the author, who of the following would be labored as intolerant? A) Someone who turns a deaf ear to others' opinions. B) Someone who can't put up with others' tastes. C) Someone who values only their own opinions. D) Someone whose opinion harm. other people. 38. The new Ford cars are cited as an example to show that ________. A) it is foolish to criticize a famous brand B) one should not always agree to others' opinions C) personal tastes are not something to be challenged D) it is unwise to express one's likes and dislikes in public 39. Considered judgment is different from personal preference in that ________. A) it is stated by judges in the court B) it reflects public like and dislikes C) it is a result of a lot of controversy D) it is based on careful thought 40. As indicated in the passage, being free to act on one's opinion ________. A) means that one can ignore other people's criticism B) means that one can impose his pre6ereaccs on others C) doesn't mean that one has the right to do things at will D) doesn't mean that one has the right to charge others without evidence Part Ⅲ					Vocabulary and Structure				(20 minutes) Directions: There are 30 incomplete sentences it: this part.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in fewest possible words. Your answer may be a word, a phrase, or a short sentence. Write your answers in the spaces provided on the right of the page. Sports is one of the world’s largest industries, and most athletes are professionals who are paid for their efforts. Because an athlete succeeds by achievement only—not by economic background or family connections—sports can be a fast route to wealth, and many athletes play only for money than for love. This has not always been true. In the ancient Olympics the winner got only a wreath of olive leaves (橄榄叶花环). Even though the winners became national heroes, the games remained amateur for centuries. Athletes won fame, but no money. As time passed, however, the contests became increasingly less amateur and cities began to hire athletes to represent them. By the fourth century A.D., the Olympics were ruined, and they were soon ended. In 1896, the Olympic games were revived (使再度兴起)with the same goal of pure amateur competition. The rules bar athletes who have ever received a $50 prize or an athletic scholars or who have spent four weeks in a training camp. At least one competitor in the 1896 games met these qualifications. He was Spiridon Loues, a water carrier who won the marathon race, after race, a rich Athenian offered him anything he wanted. A true amateur, Loues accepted only a cart and a horse. Then he gave up running forever. But Loues was an exception and now, as the Chairman of the German Olympic Committee said, “Nobody pays any attention to these rules.” Many countries pay their athletes to train year-round, and Olympic athletes are eager to sell their names to companies that make everything from ski equipment to fast food. Even the games themselves have become a huge business. Countries fight to hold the Olympics not only for honor, but for money. The 1972 games in Munich cost the Germans 545 million dollars, but by selling medal symbols, TV rights, food, drink ,hotel rooms, and souvenirs (纪念品), they managed to make a profit. Appropriately, the symbol of victory in the Olympic games is no longer a simple olive wreath—it is a gold medal. S1. To many people, sports today is nothing S1.________ but. S2.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre. Passage One Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.     I'm usually fairly skeptical about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago. While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children ages 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.     Why are 's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation -- brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things -- and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.     Given that we can't turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation cope.     At the top of the list is nurturing (培育) a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.     To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later. They will have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep.     Limit the amount of virtual (虚拟的) violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.     Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.     Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you cope with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable. But it doesn't have to ruin your life. 21. The author thinks that the conclusions of any research about people's state of mind are______. A) surprising  	B) confusing   	C) illogical   	D) questionable 22. What does the author mean when he says, "we can't turn the clock back" (Line 1, Para. 3)? A) It's impossible to slow down the pace of change. B) The social reality children are facing cannot be changed. C) Lessons learned from the past should not be forgotten. D) It's impossible to forget the past. 23. According to an analysis, compared with normal children today, children treated as mentally ill 50 years ago____. A) were less isolated physically B) were probably less self-centered   C) probably suffered less from anxiety D) were considered less individualistic 24. The first and most important thing parents should do to help their children is ____. A) to provide them with a safer environment B) to lower their expectations for them C) to get them more involved socially D) to set a good model for them to follow 25. What conclusion can be drawn from the passage? A) Anxiety, though unavoidable, can be coped with. B) Children's anxiety has been enormously exaggerated. C) Children's anxiety can be eliminated with more parental care. D) Anxiety, if properly controlled, may help children become mature. Passage Two Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.     It is easier to negotiate initial salary requirement because once you are inside, the organizational constraints (约束) influence wage increases. One thing, however, is certain: your chances of getting the raise you feel you deserve are less if you don't at least ask for it. Men tend to ask for more, and they get more, and this holds true with other resources, not just pay increases. Consider Beth's story:     I did not get what I wanted when I did not ask for it. We had cubicle (小隔间) offices and window offices. I sat in the cubicles with several male colleagues. One by one they were moved into window offices, while I remained in the cubicles, several males who were hired after me also went to offices. One in particular told me he was next in line for an office and that it had been part of his negotiations for the job. I guess they thought me content to stay in the cubicles since I did not voice my opinion either way.     It would be nice if we all received automatic pay increases equal to our merit, but "nice" isn't a quality attributed to most organizations. If you feel you deserve a significant raise in pay, you'll probably have to ask for it.     Performance is your best bargaining chip (筹码) when you are seeking a raise. You must be able to demonstrate that you deserve a raise. Timing is also a good bargaining chip. If you can give your boss something he or she needs (a new client or a sizable contract, for example) just before merit pay decisions are being made, you are more likely to get the raise you want.     Use information as a bargaining chip too. Find out what you are worth on the open market. What will someone else pay for your services?     Go into the negotiations prepared to place your chips on the table at the appropriate time and prepared to use communication style to guide the direction of the interaction. 26. According to the passage, before taking a job, a person should _____. A) demonstrate his capability   B) give his boss a good impressionC) ask for as much money as he can   D) ask for the salary he hopes to get 27. What can be inferred from Beth's story? A) Prejudice against women still exists in some organizations. B) If people want what they deserve, they have to ask for it. C) People should not be content with what they have got. D) People should be careful when negotiating for a job. 28. We can learn from the passage that ____. A) unfairness exists in salary increases B) most people are overworked and underpaid C) one should avoid overstating one's performance D) most organizations give their staff automatic pay raises 29. To get a pay raise, a person should______. A) advertise himself on the job market B) persuade his boss to sign a long-term contract C) try to get inside information about the organization D) do something to impress his boss just before merit pay decisions 30. To be successful in negotiations, one must_____. A) meet his boss at the appropriate time B) arrive at the negotiation table punctually C) be good at influencing the outcome of the interaction D) be familiar with what the boss likes and dislikes   Passage Three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.     When families gather for Christmas dinner, some will stick to formal traditions dating back to Grandma's generation. Their tables will be set with the good dishes and silver, and the dress code will be Sunday-best.     But in many other homes, this china-and-silver elegance has given way to a stoneware (粗陶) -and-stainless informality, with dresses assuming an equally casual-Friday look. For hosts and guests, the change means greater simplicity and comfort. For makers of fine china in , it spells economic hard times.     Last week Royal Doulton, the largest employer in , announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs--one-fifth of its total workforce. That brings to more than 4,000 the number of positions lost in 18 months in the pottery (陶瓷) region. Wedgwood and other pottery factories made cuts earlier.     Although a strong pound and weak markets in  play a role in the downsizing, the layoffs in Stoke have their roots in earthshaking social shifts. A spokesman for Royal Doulton admitted that the company "has been somewhat slow in catching up with the trend" toward casual dining. Families eat together less often, he explained, and more people eat alone, either because they are single or they eat in front of television;     Even dinner parties, if they happen at all, have gone casual. In a time of long work hours and demanding family schedules, busy hosts insist, rightly, that it's better to share a takeout pizza on paper plates in the family room than to wait for the perfect moment or a "real" dinner party. Too often, the perfect moment never comes. Iron a fine-patterned tablecloth? Forget it. Polish the silver? Who has time?     Yet the loss of formality has its down side. The fine points of etiquette (礼节) that children might once have learned at the table by observation or instruction from parents and grandparents ("Chew with your mouth closed." "Keep your elbows off the table.") must be picked up elsewhere. Some companies now offer etiquette seminars for employees who may be competent professionally but clueless socially. 31. The trend toward casual dining has resulted in_____. A) bankruptcy of fine china manufacturers B) shrinking of the pottery industry C) restructuring of large enterprises D) economic recession in  32. Which of the following may be the best reason for casual dining? A) Family members need more time to relax. B) Busy schedules leave people no time for formality. C) People want to practice economy in times of scarcity. D) Young people won't follow the etiquette of the older generation. 33. It can be learned from the passage that Royal Doulton is_____. A) a retailer of stainless steel tableware  B) a dealer in stoneware   C) a pottery chain store            D) a producer of fine china 34. The main cause of the layoffs in the pottery industry is_____. A) the increased value of the pound B) the economic recession in  C) the change in people's way of life D) the fierce competition at home and abroad 35. Refined table manners, though less popular than before in current social life_____. A) are still a must on certain occasions B) axe bound to return sooner or later C) are still being taught by parents at home D) can help improve personal relationships   Passage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.     Some houses are designed to be smart. Others have smart designs. An example of the second type of house won an Award of Excellence from the American Institute of Architects.     Located on the shore of Sullivan's Island off the coast of South Carolina, the award-winning cube-shaped beach house was built to replace one smashed to pieces by Hurricane (飓风) Hugo 10 years ago. In September 1989, Hugo struck , killing 18 people and damaging or destroying 36,000 homes in the state.     Before Hugo, many new houses built along 's shoreline were poorly constructed, and enforcement of building codes wasn't strict, according to architect Ray Huff, who created the cleverly-designed beach house. In Hugo's wake, all new shoreline houses are required to meet stricter, better-enforced codes. The new beach house on Sullivan's  should be able to withstand a Category 3 hurricane with peak winds of 179 to 209 kilometers per hour.     At first sight, the house on Sullivan's  looks anything but hurricane-proof. Its redwood shell makes it resemble "a large party lantern (灯笼)" at night, according to one observer. But looks can be deceiving. The house's wooden frame is reinforced with long steel rods to give it extra strength.     To further protect the house from hurricane damage, Huff raised it 2.7 meters off the ground on timber pilings -- long, slender columns of wood anchored deep in the sand. Pilings might appear insecure, but they are strong enough to support the weight of the house. They also elevate the house above storm surges. The pilings allow the surges to run under the house instead of running into it. "These swells of water come ashore at tremendous speeds and cause most of the damage done to beach-front buildings," said Huff.     Huff designed the timber pilings to be partially concealed by the house's ground-to-roof shell. "The shell masks the pilings so that the house doesn't look like it's standing with its pant legs pulled up," said Huff. In the event of a storm surge, the shell should break apart and let the waves rush under the house, the architect explained. 36. After the tragedy caused by Hurricane Hugo, new houses built along 's shore line are required_____. A) to be easily reinforced        B) to look smarter in design C) to meet stricter building standards     D) to be designed in the shape of cubes 37. The award-winning beach house is quite strong because____.  	A) it is strengthened by steel rods   B) it is made of redwood C) it is in the shape of a shell      D) it is built with timber and concrete 38. Huff raised the house 2.7 meters off the ground on timber pilings in order to _____. A) withstand peak winds of about /hr B) anchor stronger pilings deep in the sand C) break huge sea waves into smaller ones D) prevent water from rushing into the house 39. The main function of the shell is______.A) to strengthen the pilings of the house B) to give the house a better appearance C)to protect the wooden frame of the house D) to slow down the speed of the swelling water 40. It can be inferred from the passage that the shell should be____. A) fancy-looking 		B) waterproof   	C) easily breakable    	D) extremely strong Part III  						Vocabulary               (20 minutes)Directions: There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Then mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre. It's an annual back-to-school routine. One morning you wave goodbye, and that    71   evening you're burning the late-night oil in sympathy. In the race to improve educational standards,    72    are throwing the books at kids.   73   elementary school students are complaining of homework   74  . What's a well-meaning parent to do? 	As hard as   75    may be, sit back and chill, experts advise. Though you've got to get them to do it,  76   helping too much, or even examining   77   too carefully, you may keep them    78   doing it by themselves. "I wouldn't advise a parent to check every    79   assignment," says psychologist John Rosemond, author of Ending the Tough Homework. "There's a   80   of appreciation for trial and error. Let your children   81   the grade they deserve."     Many experts believe parents should gently look over the work of younger children and ask them to rethink their   82  . But "you don't want them to feel it has to be   83  ," she says. That's not to say parents should   84   homework -- first, they should monitor how much homework their kids   85  . Thirty minutes a day in the early elementary years and an hour in   86     four, five, and six is standard, says Rosemond. For junior-high students it should be "   87      mom than an hour and a half," and two for high-school students. If your child    88   has mom homework than this, you may want to check   89   other parents and then talk to the teacher about   90   assignment71.

I certainly do. And I feel that much of the world has somehow gotten away from that. Too often I see people rushing into elevators without giving those inside a chance to get off first, or never saying "thank you" when others hold a door open for them. We get lazy and in our laziness we think that something like a simple "thank you" doesn't really matter. But it can matter very much.The fact is that no matter how nicely we dress or how beautifully we decorate our homes, we can't be truly elegant without good manners, because elegance and good manners always go hand in hand. In fact, (11-C)I think of good manners as a sort of hidden beauty secret. Haven't you noticed that the kindest, most generous people seem to keep getting prettier? It's funny how that happens. But it does. Take the long-lost art of saying "thank you". Like wearing a little makeup or making sure your hair is neat, getting into the habit of saying "thank you" can make you feel better about yourself. (13-B)Good manners add to your image, while an angry face makes the best dressed person look ugly. 11. What is the passage mainly about? 12. What does the speaker say about people of the past? 13. According to the speaker, how can we best improve our image? Passage Two"Go to the playground and have fun," parents will often say to their kids. But they should remember playgrounds can be dangerous. Each year, about 200,000 children end up in hospital emergency rooms with playground injuries. Many injuries involve falls from too high equipment onto too hard surfaces. Nearly 70% of the injuries happen on public playgrounds. (14-C)Recent studies show they may be badly designed, their protective services are inadequate and their equipment is poorly maintained.  Parents should make sure that the equipment in the playground is safe and their children are playing safely. Last year, the national program for playground safely gave the nation's playgrounds a grade of C for safety after visiting more than 3,000 playgrounds nationwide. (15-B)Parents should watch closely. They should always be within shouting and running distance of their children. Young children don't understand cause and effect, so they may run in front of moving swings. They're also better at climbing up than at getting down, so they may panic at the top of a ladder. It's important for the children to know you're watching them. (16-D)Once they feel that sense of security, that's when they can be creative. 14. What is the cause of playground injuries? 15. What should parents do to prevent playground injuries? 16. What does the speaker say about young children? Passage Three     For 25 years, I was a full-time thief, specializing in picking pockets. Where I come from in southeast , that's an honorable profession. (17-A)Anyone can break in a house and steal things, but picking somebody's pocket takes skill. My sister and I were among the most successful pickpocket teams in . We worked in hotel and theatre lobbies, airports, shopping centers and restaurants. Now we don't steal anymore, but this crime is worldwide. Here's how to protect yourself:     Professional pickpockets do not see victims, only handbags, jewels and money. Mothers with babies, the elderly, the disabled are all fair game. (18-C)My preferred target was the lone female, handbag at her side, the right side to be exact. So if I'm next to her, I can reach out cautiously with my right hand across my body. Only about one woman in a thousand carries her bag on the left. And I tended to steer clear of them. Women whose bags are hanging in front of them are tricky for the pickpocket as there isn't a blind side. If you want to make it even harder, use a bag with handles rather than a strap. (19-A)For men, one of the best places to keep a wallet is in the back pocket of tight trousers. You'll feel any attempts to move it. Another good place is in the buttoned-up inside pocket of a jacket. There is just no way in. Even better, keep wallets attached to a chord or chain that is fastened to a belt.      A pickpocket needs targets who are relaxed and off-guard. (20-B)The perfect setting is a clothing store. When customers wander among the racks, they are completely absorbed in the items they hold up. The presence of a uniformed security guard is even better. A full sense of security makes the pickpocket's job much simpler. 	17. Why does the speaker say that picking somebody's pocket is an honorable profession in southeast ? 	18. According to the speaker, who is most likely to become a victim of pickpockets? 	19. In the speaker's opinion, what is the best place for a man to keep his wallet? 	20.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.  Passage One  Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.  A is for always getting to work on time.  B is for being extremely busy.  C is for the conscientious (勤勤恳恳的) way you do your job.  You may be all these things at the office, and more. But when it comes to getting ahead, experts say, the ABCs of business should include a P, for politics, as in office politics.  Dale Carnegie suggested as much more than 50 years ago hard work alone doesn’t ensure career advancement. You have to be able to sell yourself and your ideas, both publicly and behind the scenes. Yet, despite the obvious rewards of engaging in office politics—a better job, a raise, praise—many people are still unable—or unwilling—to play the game.  People assume that office politics involves some manipulative (工于心计的) behavior, says Deborah Comer, an assistant professor of management at Hofstra University. But politics derives from the word  “polite”. It can mean lobbying and forming associations. It can mean being kind and helpful, or even trying to please your superior, and then expecting something in return.  In fact, today, experts define office politics as proper behavior used to pursue one’s own self-interest in the workplace. In many cases, this involves some form of socializing within the office environment—not just in large companies, but in small workplaces as well.  The first thing people are usually judged on is their ability to perform well on a consistent basis, says Neil P. Lewis, a management psychologist. But if two or three candidates are up for a promotion, each of whom has reasonably similar ability, a manager is going to promote the person he or she likes best. It’s simple human nature.   Yet, psychologists say, many employees and employers have trouble with the concept of politics in the office. Some people, they say, have an idealistic vision of work and what it takes to succeed. Still others associate politics with flattery (奉承), fearful that, if they speak up for themselves, they may appear to be flattering their boss for favors.  Experts suggest altering this negative picture by recognizing the need for some self-promotion.  11. Office politics (Line 2, Para. 4) is used in the passage to refer to ________.  A) the code of behavior for company staff  B) the political views and beliefs of office workers  C) the interpersonal relationships within a company  D) the various qualities required for a successful career   12. To get promoted, one must not only be competent but ______.  A) give his boss a good impression  B) honest and loyal to his company   C) get along well with his colleagues  D) avoid being too outstanding 13. Why are many people unwilling to “play the game” (Line 4, Para. 5) ?A) They believe that doing so is impractical.  B) They feel that such behavior is unprincipled.  C) They are not good at manipulating colleagues.  D) They think the effort will get them nowhere.   14. The author considers office politics to be ________.  A) unwelcome at the workplace  B) bad for interpersonal relationships  C) indispensable to the development of company culture  D) an important factor for personal advancement  15. It is the author’s view that __________.  A) speaking up for oneself is part of human nature   B) self-promotion does not necessarily mean flattery  C) hard work contributes very little to one’s promotion  D) many employees fail to recognize the need of flattery  Passage Two  Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.  As soon as it was revealed that a reporter for Progressive magazine had discovered how to make a hydrogen bomb, a group of firearm (火器) fans formed the National Hydrogen Bomb Association, and they are now lobbying against any legislation to stop Americans from owning one.  The Constitution, said the association’s spokesman, gives everyone the right to own arms. It doesn’t spell out what kind of arms. But since anyone can now make a hydrogen bomb, the public should be able to buy it to protect themselves.  Don’t you think it’s dangerous to have one in the house, particularly where there are children around?The National Hydrogen Bomb Association hopes to educate people in the safe handling of this type of weapon. We are instructing owners to keep the bomb in a locked cabinet and the fuse (导火索) separately in a drawer.  Some people consider the hydrogen bomb a very fatal weapon which could kill somebody.  The spokesman said, Hydrogen bombs don’t kill people—people kill people. The bomb is for self-protection and it also has a deterrent effect. If somebody knows you have a nuclear weapon in your house, they’re going to think twice about breaking in.  But those who want to ban the bomb for American citizens claim that if you have one locked in the cabinet, with the fuse in a drawer, you would never be able to assemble it in time to stop an intruder (侵入者).  Another argument against allowing people to own a bomb is that at the moment it is very expensive to build one. So what your association is backing is a program which would allow the middle and upper classes to acquire a bomb while poor people will be left defenseless with just handguns.  16. According to the passage, some people started a national association so as to ______.  A) block any legislation to ban the private possession of the bomb  B) coordinate the mass production of the destructive weapon  C) instruct people how to keep the bomb safe at home  D) promote the large-scale sale of this newly invented weapon  17. Some people oppose the ownership of H-bombs by individuals on the grounds that _____.  A) the size of the bomb makes it difficult to keep in a drawer   B) most people don’t know how to handle the weapon  C) people’s lives will be threatened by the weapon  D) they may fall into the hands of criminals  18. By saying that the bomb also has a deterrent effect the spokesman means that it _____.  A) will frighten away any possible intruders  B) can show the special status of its owners  C) will threaten the safety of the owners as well  D) can kill those entering others’ houses by force  19. According to the passage, opponents of the private ownership of H-bombs are very much worried that _____.  A) the influence of the association is too powerful for the less privileged to overcome  B) poorly-educated Americans will find it difficult to make use of the weapon  C) the wide use of the weapon will push up living expenses tremendously  D) the cost of the weapon will put citizens on an unequal basis  20. From the tone of the passage we know that the author is _______.  A) doubtful about the necessity of keeping H-bombs at home for safety  B) unhappy with those who vote ;against the ownership of H-bombs  C) not serious about the private ownership of H-bombs  D) concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons  Passage Three  Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.  Sign has become a scientific hot button. Only in the past 20 years have specialists in language study realized that signed languages are unique—a speech of the hand. They offer a new way to probe how the brain generates and understands language, and throw new light on an old scientific controversy whether language, complete with grammar, is something that we are born with, or whether it is a learned behavior. The current interest in sign language has roots in the pioneering work of one rebel teacher at   in , the world’s only liberal arts university for deaf people.  When Bill Stokoe went to Gallaudet to teach English, the school enrolled him in a course in signing. But Stokoe noticed something odd among themselves, students signed differently from his classroom teacher.  Stokoe had been taught a sort of gestural code, each movement of the hands representing a word in English. At the time, American Sign Language (ASL) was thought to be no more than a form of pidgin English (混杂英语). But Stokoe believed the hand talk his students used looked richer. He wondered might deaf people actually have a genuine language and could that language be unlike any other on Earth It was 1955, when even deaf people dismissed their signing as substandard. Stokoe’s idea was academic heresy (异端邪说).  It is 37 years later. Stokoe—now devoting his time to writing and editing books and journals and to producing video materials on ASL and the deaf culture—is having lunch at a café near the Gallaudet campus and explaining how he started a revolution. For decades educators fought his idea that signed languages are natural languages like English, French and Japanese. They assumed language must be based on speech, the modulation (调节) of sound. But sign language is based on the movement of hands, the modulation of space. What I said, Stokoe explains, is that language is not mouth stuff—it’s brain stuff.  21. The study of sign language is thought to be ________.  A) a new way to look at the learning of language  B) a challenge to traditional views on the nature of language  C) an approach to simplifying the grammatical structure of a language  D) an attempt to clarify misunderstanding about the origin of language  22. The present growing interest in sign language was stimulated by _______.  A) a famous scholar in the study of the human brain  B) a leading specialist in the study of liberal arts  C) an English teacher in a university for the deaf  D) some senior experts in American Sign Language  23. According to Stokoe, sign language is ________.  A) a substandard language   B) a genuine language   C) an artificial language  D) an international language   24. Most educators objected to Stokoe’s idea because they thought _______.  A) sign language was not extensively used even by deaf people  B) sign language was too artificial to be widely accepted  C) a language should be easy to use and understand  D) a language could only exist in the form of speech sounds  25. Stokoe’s argument is based on his belief that _________.  A) sign language is as efficient as any other language  B) sign language is derived from natural language  C) language is a system of meaningful codes  D) language is a product of the brain  Passage Four  Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.  It came as something of a surprise when Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to  in 1997, to support the Red Cross’s campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines. Within hours of arriving in , television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims injured in explosions caused by landmines. “I knew the statistics”, she said. “But putting a face to those figures brought the reality home to me; like when I met Sandra, a 13- year-old girl who had lost her leg, and people like her.”  The Princess concluded with a simple message:  “We must stop landmines”. And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message.  But, back in , her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as very ill-informed and a loose cannon (乱放炮的人).”  he Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms. “This is a distraction (干扰) we do not need. All I’m trying to do is help.”  Opposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess’s trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in  and the British government’s policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government.  To try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess’s views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was working towards a worldwide ban. The Defense Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding.   For the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause. She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people and their problems.26. Princess Diana paid a visit to  in 1997 ________.  A) to voice her support for a total ban of landmines  B) to clarify the British government’s stand on landmines  C) to investigate the sufferings of landmine victims there  D) to establish her image as a friend of landmine victims  27. What did Diana mean when she said “ ... putting a face to those figures brought the reality home to me (Line 5, Para.1)” ?A) She just couldn’t bear to meet the landmine victims face to face.  B) The actual situation in  made her feel like going back home.  C) Meeting the landmine victims in person made her believe the statistics.  D) Seeing the pain of the victims made her realize the seriousness of the situation.  28. Some members of the British government criticized Diana because ______.  A) she was ill-informed of the government’s policy  B) they were actually opposed to banning landmines  C) she had not consulted the government before the visit  D) they believed that she had misinterpreted the situation in   29. How did Diana respond to the criticisms?A) She paid no attention to them.  B) She made more appearances on TV.  C) She met the 13-year-old girl as planned.  D) She rose to argue with her opponents.  30. What did Princess Diana think of her visit to ?A) It had caused embarrassment to the British government.  B) It had brought her closer to the ordinary people.  C) It had greatly promoted her popularity.   D) It had affected her relations with the British government.

Part II   Reading Comprehension  Passage 1全文翻译A.  总是准时上班  	B.  总是非常忙碌  	C.  勤勤恳恳做自己的工作  	也许在办公室里你符合上述的所有情况，甚至有过之而无不及。但是当谈及获得成功时，专家们认为，在事业上除了要做到ABC三条以外，还应该具备一个P，即是政治，也就是办公室政治学。戴尔·卡内基早在50多年前，就提出只靠努力工作并不能确保事业上的进步。你必须能够公开地和私下地推销自己和自己的观点，然而，尽管采用办公室政治策略所得到的好处是显而易见的——好的工作，升职，奖励——许多人还是不能或不愿去“玩这场游戏”。      “人们认为办公室政治是一种工于心计的行为，”德勃拉·卡门——霍夫斯特拉大学管理学的一名助教——这样说。“但事实上政治起源于‘礼貌’。这个词它可以意味着游说和形成联合，也能代表善良和有益，甚至力图取悦你的上司，然后期望一定回报。”事实上，现如今，专家们将办公室政治学定义为在工作场合为追求个人利益而采取的适当行为。大多数情况下，这一行为包括在办公环境里的某种社会化的形式——不仅在大公司里是这样，在小公司里也不例外。    “通常评价一个人时，首先看的是他们在同样的基础上是否能够表现出色，”尼尔·刘易斯，一位管理心理学家这样说。“但是当一次晋升的机会有两三个候选人，每一个都有相当的能力时，经理自然会选择他最喜欢的那个人。这是人之常情。”    然而，心理学家说，许多老板与员工之间就办公室政治学的概念的理解有所不同。有些人认为，对工作充满理想就能成功。而另外一些人则将政治联想为阿谀奉承。他们担心如果大声为自己说话，可能表现得像是在刻意取悦老板以求欢心。  专家建议通过认识自我完善的需求来改变这些负面描述。试题详解11．D)。推断题。依据第四段第二句话。该句指出：专家说，要想在事业上取得成功，除了具有A (按时上班)、B (勤奋)、C (踏实) 等品质外，还应该包括P (权术polities)。文章后面的部分就是对“office politics”的进一步解释说明。由此可知，office politics指的就是事业成功所需要的各种品质，故选项D) 正确。 12．A)。推断题。依据第八段内容。在该段中，管理心理学家Neil P. Lewis说：“通常情况下，首先衡量人们的标准就是在相同的情况下看他们完成工作的能力。但是，如果提升的候选人有两个或者三个，其能力又相同，经理通常会提升他所喜欢的人。这是一般的人性。”由此可以推断出：得到老板的喜欢，给老板留下一个好的印象，这也是提升所必须的一个方面。故选项A) 正确。 13．B)。语义题。从第五段内容可知，play the game指的就是“玩权术”，善于“玩权术”的人可能会得到提升、加薪、表扬等，但是很多人仍然不能够或不愿意这么做。第六段解释了许多人不愿“玩权术”的原因。首先通过构词法可知，选项B) 中的unprincipled是由“un- (不，不会) + principled (讲究原则的)”构成，故该词的意思应为“不讲究原则的，不讲道德的；不正直的”，这与文章中的manipulative (工于心计的) 相对应，故B) 项为正确答案。另外，也可用排除法；A)项 (他们认为玩权术不切实际) 与文中内容相悖；C) 项 (不擅长操纵支配同事) 文中并没提到；D) 项 (这种努力使他们一无所获) 与文中作者表达的意思相反。所以，A)，C)，D)都可排除。 14．D)。推断题。实际上作者在第四段就说明了polities在个人事业成功中的重要性。在第八段中，作者又引用管理心理学家Neil只Lewis的话，说明 “office politics” 在个人升职当中的重要性。由此可见，选项D)正确。 15．B)。主旨题。倒数第二段说：许多人不能够很好地领会权术的概念，有些人太理想化，认为付出很多就会成功 (what takes to succeed)，而另一些人却把权术与奉承联系起来，担心如果为自己讲话，好像他们是为了得到恩惠在奉承老板。接着在最后一段作者指出：通过认识到自我推荐是个人发展所必须的这一事实来改变这种消极的看法。显然，作者认为自我推荐并不意味着奉承。故B) 项为正确答案。11. C the interpersonal relationships within a company   12. A give his boss a good impression   13. B They feel that such behavior is unprincipled   14. D an important factor for personal advancement   15. B self－promotion does not necessarily mean flattery  Passage 2全文翻译一个杂志记者发现制造氢弹的方法的消息一经披露，一群火器迷就组成了国家氢弹协会并为反对禁止公民拥有氢弹的立法而游说。    这一协会的发言人说：“议会给予每个人拥有武器的权利，它并没指出是何种武器，但由于现在每个人都可以制造氢弹，公众应该可以购买氢弹用来防身。”    “你不认为把氢弹放在家里很危险吗?尤其是有孩子的家庭?”    “国际轻弹协会希望教育人们安全使用氢弹，我们告诉使用者把它锁在柜子里，导火索单独放在抽屉里。”    “有人认为氢弹是一种极度危险的可以杀死人的武器。”    发言人说：“氢弹不会杀人——人才会杀人。氢弹是用来自我保护的，同时它还有威慑作用，当别人知道你家里有氢弹时，在强行闯入前会仔细考虑。”    “但是那些反对公民拥有炸弹的人认为如果氢弹锁在柜子里而导火索在抽屉里，就不可能有足够的时间阻止入侵者。”    “另一种反对的观点认为眼下制造氢弹的费用还很昂贵，因此你们协会促成的是中上阶层拥有氢弹，而只买得起手枪的贫民则完全不能自卫。”试题详解16．A)。细节题．依据文章第一段。该文指出：进步杂志的一名记者发现如何制造氢弹的消息一经披露，一批爱好者就形成了全国氢弹协会，他们现在正在游说反对形成这样的立法，即阻止美国人拥有氢弹。由此可知，选项A) 为正确答案。17．C)。细节题。依据文章第三段和第五段内容，尤其是第五段内容，即“Some people consider the hydrogen bomb a very fatal weapon which could kill somebody．”。由此可知，选项C) 为正确答案。 18．A)。推断题。依据第六段第三句话。该句指出：如果有人知道你家有一核武器，在破门而人的时候，他会三思的。也就是说这会吓跑闯入者。故选项A) 为正确答案。”19．D)。推断题。依据文章最后一段。该段指出：反对私人拥有氢弹的人认为氢弹造价高，支持这样的计划也就等于让中产阶级和上层阶级拥有氢弹，而穷人则没有防卫能力，只能依靠手枪。这也就是说，氢弹昂贵的价格使得人们处于不平等的地位。故选项D)为正确答案。 20．A)。主旨题．作者在本文中陈述了支持私人拥有氢弹和反对私人拥有氢弹的两种观点。但针对协会发育人的每一种观点，作者都提出了疑点。显然作者对靠拥有氢弹来保证家庭安全的做法是持怀疑态度的。故选项A)为正确答案。16. A block any legislation to ban the private possession of the bomb   17. C people’s lives will be threatened by the weapon   18. A will frighten away any possible intruders   19. D the cost of the weapon will put citizens on an unequal basis   20. D concerned about the spread of nuclear weaponsPassage 3全文翻译    符号已经成为科学的一个热点。仅仅是在过去的20年里，致力于语言学研究的专家才意识到符号语言的独特性——一种手语。他们提供了一条新的途径来探究大脑如何产生与领悟语言，并就一个长期以来存在争议的科学问题阐明了新的观点：任何一种语言，连同它的语法，究竟是我们与生俱来的，还是一种后天学习的结果。当前对符号语言的兴趣始于华盛顿哥罗地大学 (世界上惟一一所专为聋哑人开设的文科院校) 一位叛逆老师的首创。    最初比尔·斯托克去哥罗地大学教英语时，学校给他登记开设的课程是符号学。但是斯托克注意到一些奇怪的现象：学生们画的符号跟课堂上老师所教授的符号有所不同。    斯托克学习过一种手语，手的每一个动作都代表了英语的一个单词。那时，美国符号语言被认为只是一种混杂的英语。但是斯托克认为他的学生们所使用的手语更为丰富。他很奇怪：难道聋哑人实际上有一种天生的语言，而这种语言跟地球上的其他语言都不相同?在1955年，即使聋哑人们也认为自己使用的语言不符合标准而废弃不用，斯托克的这一想法被认为是异端邪说。37年后的今天，斯托克正投人大量的时间就美国符号语言和聋哑文化编写书籍和杂志，并制作影音材料。他一边在哥罗地校园附近的一家小饭馆里享用午餐，一边描述自己如何发动了一场革命。数十年来，他认为符号语言像英语、法语、日语一样是自然语言的观点广直遭到教育家们的攻击。这些教育家们认为语言必须以言语和声调的调节为基础。但符号语言确是以手的动作和在空间的调节为基础。“我想说的是”，斯托克解释道：“语言不是关于嘴巴的东西——它是关于大脑的产物。试题详解21．B)。推断题。依据第一段第三句话．该句指出：手势语提供了一种新的方法来探讨大脑是如何产生语言和理解语言的，并对—个古老的科学争论提供了新的线索：人的语言连同语法到底是生来就有的还是后天习得的，由此可知，这是对传统的语言性质的观点的挑战，故选项B)为正确答案。22．C)。细节题．根据第—段倒数第一句“The current interest in sign language has roots in the pioneering work of one rebel teacher at Gallaudet University in Washington，DC，the world's only liberal arts university for deaf people．”可知，选项C)为正确答案。23．B)。细节题．依据第三段第二、第三以及第四句内容“At the time，American Sign Language (ASL) was thought to be no more than a form of pidgin English (混杂英语) 。But Stokoe believed the“hand talk”his students used looked richer。He wondered；Might deaf people usually have a genuine language?”可知，手势语是一种真正的语言。故选项B)为正确答案。24，D)。细节题。依据最后一段第三、第四句内容。该文指出：几十年来，教育家都在与手势语盲就像英语、法语和日语一样是自然语言这样的观点进行着斗争，他们认为语言必须以言语(即声音的调节)为基础。由此可知，选项D)为正确答案。 25．D)。细节题。依据最后一段最后一句话 (“What is aid，”Stokoe explains，“is that language is not mouth stuff—it’s brain stuff”)。由此可知，选项D)为正确答案。21. B a challenge to traditional views on the nature of language  22. C an English teacher in a university for the deaf   23. B a genuine language   24. D a language could only exist in the form of speech sounds   25. D language is a product of the brainPassage 4全文翻译1997年，英国戴安娜王妃访问了安哥拉，以此来支持红十字会的全面禁止杀伤性地雷的活动。这可算是惊人之举。在她到达安哥拉后的数小时之内，全世界的电视屏幕都播出了她安抚在地雷爆炸中受伤的受害者的情形。她说：“我知道一些数字，但是看到受害者所遭受的痛苦，就像我遇到的在地雷爆炸中失去一条腿的叫桑德拉的十三岁女孩以及同她有相似遭遇的人使我意识到事态的严峻。”    “我们必须禁止使用地雷。”王妃用简短的话总结说，并且利用她访问中的每个机会来重申这一观点。  ·    但当她回到伦敦时，一些不支持禁止武器的英国政府成员不赞成她的主张。愤怒的政治家们在媒体上大肆攻击戴安娜王妃，他们形容她“孤陋寡闻”、“到处乱跑”。·    王妃对这些批评不屑一顾：“这是没有必要的干扰，我想做的全部事情就是去帮助别人。”    反对党、媒体和公众立即宣布支持王妃。对政府更加不利的是，很快一些事实都浮出水面——王妃此次访问是得到外交部的同意的，而且她对安哥拉和英国政府对地雷事件的政策两方面的情况都很了解。英国政府因此陷入尴尬的境地。     为了试着减少造成的损害，外交部长马尔柯姆·里夫克顿德宣称王妃的观点并非与英国政府的政策大相径庭，英国政府要朝着全球禁雷的目标“努力”。国防部长迈克尔·波提罗说这一事件是“曲解和误会”。对于王妃来说，对这一饱受战争之苦的国家的访问是利用她的影响力向全世界展示地雷引起的危害的绝好机会。她说这次访问也给了她接触民众、了解民生的机会。试题详解26．A)。细节题。依据第一段第一句话。该句指出：……戴安娜王妃于1997年去安哥拉的目的是为了支持红十字会发起的一场全面禁止使用杀伤性地雷的运动 (．．．Princess of Wales，made a trip to Angola in l997，to support the red Cross's campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines)。由此可知选项A) 为正确答案。 27．D)。推断题．依据第一段最后一句话。该句引用戴安娜的话说：仔细看看这些数字使我充分认识到现实的严重性。在第二段又讲到：在她访问期间反复说，我们必须停止使用地雷。由此可知，选项D) 为正确答案。28．B)。推断题。依据第三段内容。该段指出：在戴安娜 (Diana) 回到伦敦后，英国政府内的部分成员不赞成戴安娜的观点，他们拒绝支持禁止使用地雷这项运动。这些愤怒的政客开始在媒体上向Diana发起攻击。由此可见，这些政客实际是反对禁止使用地雷。故选项B)为正确答案。 29．A)。细节题。依据第四段第一句话的内容“The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms (王妃不理睬这些批评)”可知，选项A)正确。句中的brush aside意思为“无视(反对意见等)，对……置之不理”，和选项A)中的pay no attention同义。30．B)。细节题。依据文章最后一句话“She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people and their problems”可知，选项B)为正确答案。26. A to voice her support for a total ban of landmines   27. D Seeing the pain of the victims made her realize the seriousness of the situation   28. B they were actually opposed to banning landmines   29. A She paid no attention to them   30. B It had brought her closer to the ordinary peoplePart Ⅲ  Vocabulary and Structure词汇   31.

The first spot we are going to visit is the Great Wall, the grandest fortification in ancient . The next sight to look around is the Ming Tombs, which is one of the best-preserved tombs for 13 emperors in Ming Dynasty more than one thousand years ago. In the afternoon, we will go for the , the royal park for Chinese ancient emperors.  Currently we are on the way to the Great Wall. Dating back to the seven century B.C., the Great Wall is constructed by respective states for fortifying against invasion of neighboring states. By the reasons of long history and its length, it becomes one of the eight wonders in the world and represents the highest wisdom and crafts.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center. Passage One Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.     Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu (流感) may make a difference in how long the misery lasts.     The American Lung Association (ALA) has issued new guidelines on combating colds and the flu, and one of the keys is being able to quickly tell the two apart. That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come.     The common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses can cause cold symptoms, while the flu is caused by three viruses--flu A, B and C. There is no cure for either illness, but the flu can be prevented by the flu vaccine (疫苗), which is, for most people, the best way to fight the flu, according to the ALA.      But if the flu does strike, quick action can help. Although the flu and common cold have many similarities, there are some obvious signs to look for.      Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. 	The  notes that it may be particularly difficult to tell when infants and preschool age children have the flu. It advises parents to call the doctor if their small children have flu-like symptoms.  	Both cold and flu symptoms can be eased with over-the-counter medications as well.  However, children and teens with a cold or flu should not take aspirin for pain relief because of the risk of Reye syndrome (综合症), a rare but serious condition of the liver and central nervous system.There is, of course, no vaccine for the common cold. But frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who have colds can reduce the likelihood of catching one. 11. According to the author, knowing the cause of the misery will help ____. 	A) shorten the duration of the illness    B) the patient buys medicine over the counter    C) the patient obtain cheaper prescription drugsD) prevent people from catching colds and the flu 12. We learn from the passage that____.    A) one doesn't need to take any medicine if he has a cold or the flu    B) aspirin should not be included in over-the-counter medicines for the flu    C) delayed treatment of the flu will harm the liver and central nervous systemD) over-the-counter drugs can be taken to ease the misery caused by a cold or the flu 13. According to the passage, to combat the flu effectively, _____.A) one should identify the virus which causes it B) one should consult a doctor as soon as possible    C) one should take medicine upon catching the diseaseD) one should remain alert when the disease is spreading 14. Which of the following symptoms will distinguish the flu from a cold? 	A) A stuffy nose.B) A high temperature.C) A sore throat. D) A dry cough15. If children have flu-like symptoms, their parents_____.    A) are advised not to give them aspirin    B) should watch out for signs of Reye syndrome    C) are encouraged to take them to hospital for vaccinationD) should prevent them from mixing with people running a fever Passage Two Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.     In a time of low academic achievement by children in the , many Americans are turning to , a country of high academic achievement and economic success, for possible answers. However, the answers provided by Japanese preschools are not the ones Americans expected to find. In most Japanese preschools, surprisingly little emphasis is put on academic instruction. In one investigation, 300 Japanese and 210 American preschool teachers, child development specialists, and parents were asked about various aspects of early childhood education. Only 2 percent of the Japanese respondents (答问卷者) listed "to give children a good start academically" as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools. In contrast, over half the American respondents chose-this as one of their top three choices. To prepare children for successful careers in first grade and beyond, Japanese schools do not teach reading, writing, and mathematics, but rather skills such as persistence, concentration, and the ability to function as a member of a group, The vast majority of young Japanese children are taught to read at home by their parents.     In the recent comparison of Japanese and American preschool education, 91 percent of Japanese respondents chose providing children with a group experience as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools. Sixty-two percent of the more individually oriented (强调个性发展的) Americans listed group experience as one of their top three choices. An emphasis on the importance of the group seen in Japanese early childhood education continues into elementary school education.Like in , there is diversity in Japanese early childhood education. Some Japanese kindergartens have specific aims, such as early musical training or potential development.  In large cities, some kindergartens are attached to universities that have elementary and secondary schools. Some Japanese parents believe that if their young children attend a university-based program, it will increase the children's chances of eventually being admitted to top-rated schools and universities. Several more progressive programs have introduced free play as a way out for the heavy intellectualizing in some Japanese kindergartens. 16. We learn from the first paragraph that many Americans believe____.  	A) Japanese parents are more involved in preschool education than American parents    B) 's economic success is a result of its scientific achievements    C) Japanese preschool education emphasizes academic instructionD) 's higher education is superior to theirs 17. Most Americans surveyed believe that preschools should' also attach importance to_____.    A) problem solving               		B) group experienceC) parental guidance                 	D) individually-oriented development 18. In 's preschool education, the focus is on    A) preparing children academically      	B) developing children's artistic interestsC) tapping children's potential         	D) shaping children's character 19. Free play has been introduced in some Japanese kindergartens in order to ______.    A) broaden children's horizon          	B) cultivate children's creativityC) lighten children's study load         	D) enrich children's knowledge 20. Why do some Japanese parents send their children to university based kindergartens?    A) They can do better in their future studies.    B) They can accumulate more group experience there.    C) They can be individually oriented when they grow up.D) They can have better chances of getting a first-rate education. Passage ThreeQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.     Lead deposits, which accumulated in soil and snow during the 1960's and 70's, were primarily the result of leaded gasoline emissions originating in the . In the twenty years that the Clean Air Act has mandated unleaded gas use in the , the lead accumulation worldwide has decreased significantly.     A study published recently in the journal Nature shows that air-borne leaded gas emissions from the  were the leading contributor to the high concentration of lead in the snow in . The new study is a result of the continued research led by Dr. Charles Boutron, an expert on the impact of heavy metals on the environment at the   for Scientific Research in . A study by Dr. Boutron published in 1991 showed that lead levels in arctic (北极的) snow were declining.     In his new study, Dr. Boutron found the ratios of the different forms of lead in the leaded gasoline used in the  were different from the ratios of European, Asian and Canadian gasolines and thus enabled scientists to differentiate (分区) the lead sources.  The dominant lead ratio found in Greenland snow matched that found in gasoline from the .     In a study published in the journal Ambio, scientists found that lead levels in soil in the  had decreased markedly since the introduction of unleaded gasoline.     Many scientists had believed that the lead would stay in soil and snow for a longer period.     The authors of the Ambio study examined samples of the upper layers of soil taken from the same sites of 30 forest floors in ,  and  in 1980 and in 1990.  The forest environment processed and redistributed the lead faster than the scientists had expected.Scientists say both studies demonstrate that certain parts of the ecosystem (生态系统) respond rapidly to reductions in atmospheric pollution, but that these findings should not be used as a license to pollute.21. The study published in the journal Nature indicates that______.    A) the Clean Air Act has not produced the desired results    B) lead deposits in arctic snow are on the increase    C) lead will stay in soil and snow longer than expectedD) the  is the major source of lead pollution in arctic snow 22. Lead accumulation worldwide decreased significantly after the use of unleaded gas in the     A) was discouraged       		B) was enforced by lawC) was prohibited by law 		D) was introduced 23. How did scientists discover the source of lead pollution in ?    A) By analyzing the data published in journals like Nature and Ambio.    B) By observing the lead accumulations in different parts of the arctic area.    C) By studying the chemical elements of soil and snow in .    D) By comparing the chemical compositions of leaded gasoline used in various countries. 24. The authors of the Ambio study have found that ______.    A) forests get rid of lead pollution faster than expected    B) lead accumulations in forests are more difficult to deal with    C) lead deposits are widely distributed in the forests of the D) the upper layers of soil in forests are easily polluted by lead emissions 25. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that scientists______.    A) are puzzled by the mystery of forest pollution    B) feel relieved by the use of unleaded gasoline    C) still consider lead pollution a problemD) lack sufficient means to combat lead pollution Passage Four Question 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.  	Exercise is one of the few factors with a positive role in long-term maintenance of body weight. Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to "light" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical exertion. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to shed pounds said they were combining exercise with their diet.   	In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to briskly walk three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry (小甜饼). Even exercise professionals concede half a point here. "Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight," says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.  	Still, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the  of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight.If you have been sedentary (极少活动的) and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight. 26. What is said about the average American in the passage?   	A) They tend to exaggerate the healthful effect of "light" beer.   	B) They usually ignore the effect of exercise on losing weight.   	C) They prefer "light" beer and low-calorie bread to other drinks and food.   	D) They know the actors that play a positive role in keeping down body weight 27. Some people dislike exercise because_____.    A) they think it is physically exhausting    B) they find it hard to exercise while on a diet    C) they don't think it possible to walk 3 miles every dayD) they find consulting caloric-expenditure charts troublesome 28. "Even exercise professionals concede half a point here" (line 3, Para. 2) means "They ____.    A) agree that the calories in a small piece of pastry can be difficult to work off by exercise    B) partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction    C) are not fully convinced that dieting can help maintain one's new weightD) are not sufficiently informed of the positive role of exercise in losing weight 29. What was confirmed by the 's study?     A) Controlling one's calorie intake is more important than doing exercise.     B) Even occasional exercise can help reduce weight.     C) Weight reduction is impossible without exercise.     D) One could lose ten pounds in a year's time if there's no increase in food intake.30. What is the author's purpose in writing this article?     A) To justify the study of the .     B) To stress the importance of maintaining proper weight.     C) To support the statement made by York Onnen.

We have (S2) investigated a range of different models to see which is the best (S3) value for money. After a number of different tests and interviews with people who are (S4) familiar with the different cameras being assessed, our researchers (S5) recommend the Olympic BY model as the best auto-focus camera available at the moment.

(SIO) the only problem was the slightly awkwardness in loading the film.Part II   Reading Comprehension  Passage 1全文翻译喉咙发痒、鼻子堵塞、全身酸痛都会让人感觉糟糕，但是从这些症状并不能判断是由伤风感冒引起的还是由流感引起的，但能判断这种糟糕的感觉会持续多久。美国肺脏协会针对战胜伤风感冒和流感问题发布了新的指导方针：，关键就是能把二者很快地区分开来。这是因为用于治疗流感的处方药需要在得病后不久服用，而对于伤风感冒来说，越早服用非处方药情况越好。     普通的伤风感冒和流感都是由病毒引起的。200多种病毒都可以引起感冒症状，而流感是由 A、B、C这三种病毒引起的。这二种病状都没有治愈的方法，但是根据美国肺脏协会的建议，对于大多数人来说预防流感的最好方法是注射流感疫苗。    得了流感后，快速的行动是有效的。虽然伤风感冒和流感有许多共同之处，但是也有许多明显的标志可以区分。    鼻子堵塞、流鼻涕、喉咙发痒等伤风症状是逐渐出现并发展的，成年人和十多岁的人都不会发烧。另一方面，对于任何年龄段来讲发烧是流感的显著特征之一。总的来说，流感症状比伤风感冒更严重，流感症状包括发烧、发冷、喉咙肿痛、突然的全身酸痛。    美国肺脏协会指出，判断婴儿和学前儿童的流感是尤其困难的。他建议如果小孩子出现了流感相似症状，父母要马上带他们去看医生。    伤风感冒和流感都可以服用非处方药来缓解。但是，儿童和十多岁的孩子不能服用阿司匹林来缓解伤风流感带来的疼痛，因为这有可能导致Reye综合症，会使肝脏和中枢神经系统处于少见的严重状态。    当然，没有疫苗可以防治普通感冒。但是勤洗手、避免和感冒者的密切接触可以减少得病的可能性。试题详解11. 细节题。依据文章第一段可知“喉咙发痒、鼻子堵塞、全身酸痛都会让人感觉糟糕，但是从这些症状并不能判断是由伤风感冒引起的还是由流感引起的，能判断这种糟糕的感觉会持续多久”由此可直接选出正确答案是A。12. 细节题。由第七段第一句可知D项正确。A选项与第二段内容不符；B项内容文中未提到；C选项与第七段内容不符。 13. 细节题, 正确答案是C。。第二段都是在讲及时服药的重要性。A选项是不现实的；B选项文中只有提及婴儿和学前儿童时才适用；D项“在疾病扩散蔓延时保持机敏”文中没有直接体现。14. 细节题, 正确答案是B。。从第五段第二句可知“对于任何年龄段来讲发烧是流感的显著特征之—” 。15. 细节题, 正确答案是A。第七段第二句直接指明了:儿童和十多岁的孩子不能服用阿司匹林来缓解伤风流感带来的疼痛，因为这有可能导致Reye综合症，会使肝脏和中枢神经系统处于少见的严重状态。Passage 2 全文翻译    考虑到美国儿童学业成绩较低的情况，许多美国人试着把孩子送到日本读书，那里经济发达而且儿童学业成绩不错。然而，日本学前教育的情况并不像美国家长所期待的那样。在大多数的日本学前班里，教授知识仅占很小的比重。在一项调查中，300名日本老师和210名美国教师、儿童发展专家和家长被问及早期儿童教育的不同方面问题。在回答设立学前班的目的时只有2%的日本被调查者把“提供给孩子良好的知识基础”列为目的的前三位，与之相对比的是，有半数以上的美国被调查者把此项列为学前教育目的的前三位。为使孩子在一年级和以后的阶段里有好的表现，日本学校并不教授阅读、写作和数学，而是强调培养孩子的毅力、注意力和团队合作能力，绝大多数的日本儿童在家里由父母来教授阅读。    在最近对美国和日本学前教育的比较中，91%的日本被调查者把提供给孩子团队经验作为设立学前教育目的的前三位，而更加强调个性发展的美国人中此比例只占62%。这种日本早期教育中对团队重要性的强调一直持续到小学教育。    和美国一样，日本早期教育也呈现出多样性。一些日本幼儿园有特殊的目标，例如早期的音乐训练和潜能开发。在大城市，幼儿园、小学和初中成为大学的附属校。一些日本家长认为如果把孩子送到这种大学的附属校，会提高孩子最终被顶级学校和大学录取的机会。更有甚者，几个学校把自由玩耍作为突破个别日本幼儿园对学业知识过于注重的方式。试题详解16. 细节题。从第一段的前三句话中我们可以很容易地看出 “美国儿童学业成绩较低的情况，许多美国人试着把孩子送到日本读书，那里经济发达而且儿童学业成绩不错。然而，日本学前教育的情况并不像美国家长所期待的那样。在大多数的日本学前班里，知识的教授仅占很小的比重。”故C正确。17. 细节题。这道题从第二段的第二句可以直接选出答案B。 18. 推理判断题。A选项与全文的中心思想不符；B、C选项是片面的概括；D选项把文中提到的 “persistence，concentration，and the ability to function as a member of a group”很好的概括为“shaping children's character”，故D为正确的选项。 19. 细节题。此题可以从全文的最后一句话得出答案。其他三个选项“扩大孩子的视野”“培养孩子的创造力”和“丰富孩子的知识”文中无明确的说明。 20. 细节题。此题可以从全文的最后一段的第四句话得出答案。其中“top-rated”与“first-rate"意思相同。Passage 3全文翻译在二十世纪六七十年代堆积在土壤和雪中的铅的沉积是起源于美国的含铅汽油散发的主要结果。空气洁净法要求使用不含铅的汽油，在执行此法案的二十年里，全球范围内铅的沉积现象大大减少。    最近一份由《自然》杂志刊出的报告指出，美国含铅汽油的散发是格陵兰岛雪中铅含量过高的主要原因。这项新的研究是Charles Boutron博士不断研究的结果，他是法国国家科学研究中心研究环境中重金属影响方面的专家。在1991年他发表的一项研究表明北极雪中铅的含量正在降低。    在他的新研究中，Boutron博土发现在美国使用的含铅汽油中不同种铅的比率与在欧洲、亚洲和加拿大使用的含铅汽油中铅的比率是不同的，这能使科学家找出铅的来源。在格陵兰岛雪中铅含量的比率与美国汽油中铅含量的比率相吻合。    在Ambio杂志刊登的一项研究中，科学家们发现自从使用了不含铅汽油后，美国东北部土壤中铅的含量有了显著的下降。     许多科学家认为，沉积在土壤和雪中的铅将会存在较长的时间。    在1980年和1990年，在Ambio杂志刊登这份研究的作者检验了新英格兰、纽约和宾夕法尼亚州30个森林层相同地点的表层土样本。森林环境的处理和铅的再分布速度出乎科学家们的意料之外。    科学家们说，这两项研究表明部分生态系统会对空气污染的减少做出快速得反映，但这些发现不应该被用作污染的借口。试题详解21. 细节题。A选项与第一段第二句话的意思相悖；B选项中“on the increase” 与文中“decline”不符；C选项不是《自然》杂志刊出的；由第二段第一句话可知D正确。 22. 细节题。此题可从第一段第二句话: 空气洁净法要求使用不含铅的汽油，在执行此法案的二十年里，全球范围内铅的沉积大大减少; 可得出正确答案B。enforce意为“坚持；加强”。 23. 推理判断题。从第三段第一句话中可以得知各国含铅汽油中铅的比率是不同的，因此通过比较含铅汽油中的化学成分就可以知道污染源。而其他三项：“分析出版物中的数据”; “观察北极地区不同地区铅的沉积情况”; “研究美国东北部土壤和雪中的化学成分”文中未提及。 24. 细节题。此题可以从第六段“森林环境的处理和铅的再分布速度出乎科学家们的意料之外。”得到正确答案A。25. 推理判断题。从最后一段“科学家们说，这两项研究表明部分生态系统会对空气污染的减少做出快速的反映，但这些发现不应该被用作污染的借口。”可以得出科学家们还是把铅污染看作一个问题对待的，对此问题并不是“迷惑的”“解脱的”“没有足够办法的”。 Passage 4  全文翻译运动是少数几个能对长期保持体重起积极效果的因素之一。不幸的是，这一点并没有应用到大多数美国人的生活中去，他们宁愿选择喝低度啤酒、吃低热量的面包而不愿意增加运动量。例如，疾病控制中心发现少于四分之一的美国减肥者能够把运动与节食结合起来。    由于拒绝运动，一些人会因热量消耗表而气馁。举例来说，一个人要快步行走三公里来消耗掉一块美味小甜饼所包含的275卡路里。即使专业的训练也仅减少0.5卡路里而已。“仅靠运动本身来减肥是非常艰苦的”，保健和运动的节目主持人York Onnen说。    然而，运动在减肥中的辅助作用是至关重要的。波士顿大学医学中心针对肥胖警察及公共雇员的一项研究表明，不运动的节食者的体重很容易反弹，而把运动纳入到日常生活中来的人可以维持他们现在的体重。如果你缺乏运动而又决定每天步行，那么运动每天可以消耗掉多余的100卡路里。假设你的饮食没有增加，在一年的时间里你可以减掉十镑。通过不断地增加步行的距离和调整饮食，你甚至可以减的更多。试题详解26. 细节题。此题可以从第一段的第一、二句找到答案。选项A和C与主题没有直接的联系，D选项没有被明确的提及，而且本文侧重指出“运动是在实际应用中被忽略的”。 27. 推理判断题。在第二段中，作者提到要减肥就要消耗热量，要消耗热量就要运动，而“运动本身是非常艰苦的”，由此我们可以推断出大多数人不喜欢运动的原因是“生理上的筋疲力尽”。 28. 推理判断题。这句话的意思是说“一个人要快步行走三公里来消耗掉一块美味小甜饼所包含的275卡路里，即使专业的训练也仅减少0.5卡路里而已。”而A和C选项对“节食”的讨论偏离了文章和此段的主题，是间接引申出来的。D选项“他们没有被充分的告知运动在减肥中的积极作用”是不正确的。 29. 推理判断题。文中第三段的研究表明“不运动的节食者的体重很容易反弹，而把运动纳入到日常生活中来的人可以维持他们现在的体重”，因此可以自然得出结论“没有运动减肥是不可能的”。A和D选项片面强调了节食的作用，B选项中“occasional exercise”与文中“work exercise into their daily routine”不符。 30. 推理判断题。通读全篇文章，作者写作的目的是要说明“运动是减肥的最有效方式”。Part Ⅲ  Vocabulary and Structure31.

President Bush certainly thinks so. He has argued that tapping ANWR’s oil would help ease ’s electricity crisis and provide a major boost to the country’s energy independence. But no one knows for sure how much crude oil lies buried beneath the frozen earth with the last government survey, conducted in 1998, projecting output anywhere from 3 billion to 16 billion barrels.The oil industry goes with the high end of the range, which could equal as much as 10% of  consumption for as long as six years. By pumping more than 1 million barrels a day from the reserve for the next two three decades, lobbyists claim, the nation could cut back on imports equivalent to all shipments to the  from . Sounds good. An oil boom would also mean a multibillion-dollar windfall（意外之财）in tax revenues, royalties (开采权使用费) and leasing fees for Alaska and the Federal Government. Best of all, advocates of drilling say , damage to the environment would be insignificant . “We’ve never had a document case of oil rig chasing deer out onto the pack ice.” says Alaska State Representative Scott Ogan.Not so fast, say environmentalists . Sticking to the low end of government estimates, the National Resources Defense Council says there may be no more than 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the coastal plain of ANWR, a drop in the bucket that would do virtually nothing to ease ’s energy problems. And consumers would wait up to a decade to gain any benefits, because drilling could begin only after much bargaining over leases, environmental permits and regulatory review. As for ANWR’s impact on the  power crisis, environmentalists point out that oil is responsible for only 1% of the ’s electricity output –and just 3% of the nation’s.21. What does President Bush think of tapping oil in ANWR?A) It will exhaust the nation’s oil reserves.B) It will help secure the future of ANWR.C) It will help reduce the nation’s oil imports D) It will increase ’s energy consumption 22. We learn from the second paragraph that the American oil industry _______A) believes that drilling for oil in ANWR will produce high yields B) tends to exaggerate ’s reliance on foreign oilC) shows little interest in tapping oil in ANWR D) expects to stop oil imports from   23. Those against oil drilling in ANWR argue that _________A) it can cause serious damage to the environment B) it can do little to solve  energy problems C) it will drain the oil reserves in the Alaskan region D) it will not have much commercial value 24. What do the environmentalists mean by saying “Not so fast” (Line 1,  .3)? A) Oil exploitation takes a long timeB) The oil drilling should be delayedC) Don’t be too optimisticD) Don’t expect fast returns25. It can be learned from the passage that oil exploitation beneath ANWR’s frozen earth ________.A) remains a controversial issue B) is expected to get under way soon C) involves a lot of technological problems D) will enable the  to be oil independent Passage two Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:   “Tear ‘em apart!”  “Kill the fool!” “ Murder the referee ( 裁判)！” These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let’s not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us .It has been shown that words having certain connotations (含义)  may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior . I see the term “opponent” as one of those words . Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms.The dictionary meaning of the term “opponent “is “adversary “:“enemy “; “one who opposes your interests.” “Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one’s intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player’s request for a time out for a glove change because he did not considered then wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. “Are they wet enough now?”In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent’s international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior.Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated (提升) the game to the level where it belongs thereby setting an example to the rest of the sporting world . Replacing the term “opponent” with “associate” could be an ideal way to start.The dictionary meaning of the term “associate “ is “colleague”; “friend” ; “companion.” Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term “associate” rather than “opponent.”26. Which of the following statements best expresses the author’s view?A) Aggressive behavior in sports can have serious consequences B) The words people use can influence their behavior C) Unpleasant words in sports are often used by foreign athletes D) Unfair judgments by referees will lead to violence on the sports field 27. Harsh words are spoken during games because the players _______A) are too eager to win B) are usually short-tempered and easily offended C) cannot afford to be polite in fierce competition D) treat their rivals as enemies 28. What did the handball player do when he was not allowed a time out to change his gloves?A) He refused to continue the game B) He angrily hit the referee with a ball C) He claimed that the referee was unfair D) He wet his gloves by rubbing them across his T-shirt 29. According to the passage, players, in a game , may _______A) deliberately throw the ball at anyone illegally blocking their way B) keep on screaming and shouting throughout the game C) lie down on the ground as an act of protest D) kick the ball across the court with force 30. The author hopes to have the current situation in sports improved by _______A) calling on players to use clean language on the court B) raising the referee’s sense of responsibility C) changing the attitude of players on the sports field D) regulating the relationship between players and referees Passage three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:   	Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge (大杂烩) of environmental claims made by household products, according to a “green labeling” study published by Consumers International Friday .   	Among the report’s more outrageous (令人无法容忍的) findings-a German fertilizer described itself as “ earthworm friendly” a brand of flour said it was “non-polluting” and a British toilet paper claimed to be “environmentally friendlier”    	The study was written and researched by ’s National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumer International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.“While many good and useful claims are being made , it is clear there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impact of products they buy,” said Consumers International director Anna Fielder .The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in . Western Europe, Scandinavia and the . It found that products sold in  and the  made the most environmental claims on average. The report focused on claims made by specific products , such as detergent (洗涤剂) insect sprays and by some garden products . It did not test the claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September ,1999.Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.“Many products had specially-designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly , but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing ,” said report researcher Philip Page .“Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims . while paints were third on our list with 73 .The high numbers show how very confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading .” he said .The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging , because terms such as “environmentally friendly” and “non-polluting” cannot be verified . “ what we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO .” said Page.31. According to the passage, the NCC found it outrageous that ______A) all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards B) the claims made by products are often unclear or deceiving C) consumers would believe many of the manufactures’ claim D) few products actually prove to be environment friendly 32. As indicated in this passage , with so many good claims, the consumers _____.A) are becoming more cautious about the products they are going to buy B) are still not willing to pay more for products with green labeling C) are becoming more aware of the effects different products have on the environment D) still do not know the exact impact of different products on the environment 33. A study was carried out by ’s NCC to _______A) find out how many claims made by products fail to meet environmental standards B) inform the consumers of the environmental impact of the products they buy C) examine claims made by products against ISO standards D) revise the guidelines set by the International Standards Organization34. What is one of the consequences caused by the many claims of household products? A) They are likely to lead to serious environmental problems B) Consumers find it difficult to tell the true from the false C) They could arouse widespread anger among consumer D) Consumers will be tempted to buy products they don’t need 35. It can be inferred from the passage that the lobby group Consumer International wants to _______.A) make product labeling satisfy ISO requirementsB) see all household products meet environmental standards C) warn consumers of the danger of so-called green products D) verify the efforts of non-polluting products Passage four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:   	Two hours from the tall buildings of  and  live some of the world’s largest black bears . They are in northern ’s , a home they share with an abundance of other wildlife .   	The streams , lakes , meadows (草地) , mountain  ridges and forests that make the Poconos an ideal place for black bears have also attracted more people to the region . Open spaces are threatened by plans for housing estates and important habitats (栖息地) are endangered by highway construction . To protect the Poconos’ natural beauty from irresponsible development. The Nature Conservancy (大自然保护协会)  named the area one of America’ s “Last Great Places”    	Operating out of a century-old schoolhouse in the  of , , the conservancy’s bud Cook is working with local people and business leaders to balance economic growth with environmental protection. By forging partnerships with people like Francis Altemose, the Conservancy has been able to protect more than 14,000 acres of environmentally important land in the area.   	Altemose’s family has farmed in the Pocono area for generations. Two years ago Francis worked with the Conservancy to include his farm in a county farmland protection program. As a result, his family’s land can be protected from development and the Altemoses will be better able to provide a secure  financial future for their 7-year-old grandson .   	Cook attributes the Conservancy’s success in the Poconos to having a local presence and a commitment to working with local residents “The key to protecting these remarkable lands is connecting with the local community,” Cook  said. “The people who live there respect the land. They value quite forests, clear streams and abundant wildlife. They are eager to help with conservation effort.For more information on how you can help The Nature Conservancy protect the Poconos and the world’s other “Last Great Places,” please call 1-888-564 6864.  or visit us on the World Wide Web at www.tnc.org.36. The purpose in naming the Poconos as one of ’s “ Last Great Places “ is to ______.A) gain support from the local community B) protect it from irresponsible development C) make it a better home for black bears D) provide financial security for future generations 37. We learn from the passage that _______.A) the population in the Pocono area is growing B) wildlife in the Pocono area is dying out rapidly C) the security of the Pocono residents is being threatened D) farmlands in the Pocono area are shrinking fast 38. What is important in protecting the Poconos according to Cook?A) The setting up of an environmental protection website B) Support from organizations like The Nature ConservancyC) Cooperation with the local residents and business leaders D) Inclusion of farmlands in the region’s protection program39. What does Bud Cook mean by “having a local presence “ (Line 1, . 5)? A) Financial contributions from local business leaders B) Consideration of the interests of the local residents C) The establishment of a wildlife protection foundation in the area D) The setting up of a local Nature Conservancy branch in the Pocono area 40.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words (not exceeding 10 words.)   	We commonly think of sportsmanship in connection with athletic contests, but it also applies to individual outdoor sports. Not everyone who picks up a fishing rod or goes out with a gun is a sportsman. The sportsman first of all obeys the fish and game laws, not because he is liable to be punished as a violator, but because he know that in the main these laws are made for his best interests.   	The following are some of the things that those who would qualify for membership in the sportsmanship fraternity (圈内人) will do.1. Take no more game than the bag limit provided for by the fish and game laws. The person who comes back from a trip boasting about the large number of fish or game taken is not a sportsman but a game hog (贪得无厌的捕猎者) .2. Observe the unwritten rules of fair play. This means shooting game birds only when the birds are “on the wing”. For the same reason, do not use a shotgun to shoot a rabbit or similar animal while it is sitting or standing still.3. Be careful in removing illegal or undersized fish from the hook. This should be done only after wetting the hands . This is necessary because the body of the fish is covered with a thin, protective film which will stick to your dry hands. If the hands are dry when the fish is handled, the film is torn from the body of the fish. Without the protective film, the fish is more easily attacked by diseases. If you wish to release a fish that is hooked in such a way that it will be impossible to close to the hook as convenient. In a remarkably short time, the hook will break down and the fish will remain almost unharmed. Fish have been known to feed successfully while hooks were still in their lips.4. Be sure of the identity of your target before you shoot. Many useful and harmless species of wildlife are thoughtlessly killed by the uninformed person who is out with a gun to kill whatever flies within range. S1. In what respect does the author think individual outdoor sports are similar to athletic contests? __________.S2.

Millions of us get up each morning already weary over the day holds. “I just can’t get started.” People say. But it’s not physical energy that most of us lack. Sure, we could all use extra sleep and a better diet. But in truth, people are healthier today than at any time in history. I can almost guarantee that if you long for more energy, the problem is not with your body.What you’re seeking is not physical energy. It’s emotional energy. Yet, sad to say life sometimes seems designed to exhaust our supply. We work too hard. We have family obligations. We encounter emergencies and personal crises. No wonder so many of us suffer from emotional fatigue, a kind of utter exhaustion of the spirit.And yet we all know people who are filled with joy, despite the unpleasant circumstances of their lives. Even as a child I observed people who were poor or disabled or ill, but who nonetheless faced life with optimism and vigor. Consider Laura Hillenbrand, who despite an extremely weak body wrote the best-seller Seabiscuit. Hillenbrand barely had enough physical energy to drag herself out of be to write. But she was fueled by having a story she wanted to share. It was emotional energy that helped her succeed.Unlike physical energy, which is finite and diminishes with age, emotional energy is unlimited and has nothing to do with genes or upbringing. So how do you get it? You can’t simply tell yourself to be positive. You must take action. Here are six practical strategies that work.1. Do something new.Very little that’s new occurs in our lives. The impact of this sameness on our emotional energy is gradual, but huge: It’s like a tire with a slow leak. You don’t it at first, but eventually you’ll get a flat. It’s up to you to plug the leak--even though there are always a dozen reasons to stay stuck in your dull routines of life. That’s where Maura, 36, a waitress, found herself a year ago.Fortunately, Maura had a lifeline--a group of women friends who meet regularly to discuss their lives. Their lively discussions spurred Maura to make small but nevertheless life altering changes. She joined a gym in the next town. She changed her look with a short haircut and new black T-shirts. Eventually, Maura gathered the courage to quit her job and start her own business.Here’s a challenge: If it’s something you wouldn’t ordinarily do, do it. Try a dish you’ve never eaten. Listen to music you’d ordinarily tune out. You’ll discover these small things add to your emotional energy.2. Reclaim life’s meaning.So many of my patients tell me that their lives used to have meaning, but that somewhere along the line things went state.The first step in solving this meaning shortage is to figure out what you really care about, and then do something about it. A case in point is Ivy, 57, a pioneer in investment banking. "I mistakenly believed that all the money I made would mean something." she says. "But I feel lost, like a 22-year-old wondering what to do with her life." Ivy’s solution? She started a program that shows Wall Streeters how to donate time and money to poor children. In the process, Ivy filled her life with meaning.3. Put yourself in the fun zone.Most of us grown-ups are seriously fun-deprived. High-energy people have the same day-to-day work as the rest of us, but they manage to find something enjoyable in every situation. A real estate broker I know keeps herself amused on the job by mentally redecorating the houses she shows to clients. "I love imagining what even the most run-down house could look like withy a little tender loving care," she says. "It’s a challenge--and the least desirable properties are usually the most fun."We all define fun differently, of course, but I can guarantee this: If you put just a bit of it into your day, you energy will increase quickly.4. Bid farewell to guilt and regret.Everyone’s past is filled with regrets that still cause pain. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are dead weights that keep us from us from moving forward. While they can’t merely be willed away, I do recommend you remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.5. Make up your mind.Say you’ve been thinking about cutting your hair short. Will it look stylish – or too extreme?You endlessly think it over. Having the decision hanging over your head is a huge energy drain.Every time you can’t decide, you burden yourself with alternatives. Quit thinking that you have to make the right decision; instead, make a choice and don’t look back.6. Give to get.Emotional energy has a kind of magical quality; the more you give, the more you get back.. This is the difference between emotional and physical energy. With the latter. You have to get it to be able to give it. With the former, however, you get it by giving it.Start by asking everyone you meet, “How are you?” as if you really want to know, then listen to the reply. Be the one who hears. Most of us also need to smile more often. If you don’t smile at the person you love first thing in the morning, you’re sucking energy out of your relationship. Finally, help another person—and make the help real, concrete. Give a massage (按摩) to someone you love, or cook her dinner, Then, expand the circle to work.

Many in-home jobs that used to be done   47   by women----ranging from family shopping to preparing meals to doing   48   work——still need to be done by someone .Husbands and children now do some of these jobs, a   49   that has changed the target market for many products. Or a working woman may face a crushing “poverty of time “and look for help elsewhere, creating opportunities for producers of frozen meals, child care centers, dry cleaners, financial services, and the like.Although there is still a big wage   50   between men and women, the income working women   51   gives them new independence and buying power. For example, women now    52   about half of all cars. Not long ago, many cars dealers   53   women shoppers by ignoring them or suggesting that they come back with their husbands. Now car companies have realized that women are   54   customers. It’s interesting that some leading Japanese car dealers were the first to   55   pay attention to women customers. In , fewer women have jobs or buy cars — the Japanese society is still very much male—oriented. Perhaps it was the   56   contrast with Japanese society that prompted American firms to pay more attention to women buyers.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答A）scale			B）retailed			C）generate			D）extreme E）technically 	F）affordable 		G）situation 			H）really I）potential 		J）gap				K）voluntary 		L）excessive M）insulted 		N）purchase 			O）primarilySection BDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them are four choices marked A), B), C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestion 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.Reading new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of , .Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in . As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of ,  and , Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. “My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water.” He says.But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, ’s municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo’s Aquafina and Coca-Cola’s Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water.As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate (垂涎) over the profits. A restaurant’s typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it’s often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren’t available in stores, most dines don’t notice or care.As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it.Regardless of how it’s sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。57.

By saying “ My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water” (Line 4,  2), von Wiesenberg wants to convey the message that ________.A. plain tap water is certainly unfit for drinking B. bottled water is clearly superior to tap water C. bottled water often appeals more to dogs taste D. dogs can usually detect a fine difference in taste 59. The “fancier brands” (Line 3 Para 5) refers to ________.A. tap water from the     B. famous wines not sold in ordinary stores   C. PepsiCo’s Aquafina and Coca-Cola’s Dasani   D. expensive bottled water with impressive names 60. Why are some restaurants turning up the pressure to sell bottled water?   A.

According to passage, why is bottled water so popular?   A. It is much cheaper than wine.B. It is considered healthier.C. It appeals to more cultivated people.D. It is more widely promoted in the market.Passage TwoAs we have seen, the focus of medical care in our society has been shifting from curing disease to preventing disease – especially in terms of changing our many unhealthy behaviors, such as poor eating habits, smoking, and failure to exercise. The line of thought involved in this shift can be pursued further. Imagine a person who is about the right weight , but does not eat very nutritious (有营养的) foods, who feels OK but exercises only occasionally, who goes to work every day, but is not an outstanding worker, who drinks a few beers at home most nights but does not drive while drunk , and who has no chest pains or abnormal blood counts, but sleeps a lot and often feels tired. This person is not ill. He may not even be at risk for any particular disease. But we can imagine that this person could be a lot healthier.The field of medicine has not traditionally distinguished between someone who is merely “ not ill” and someone who is in excellent health and pays attention to the body’s special needs. Both types have simply been called “well”. In recent years, however, some health specialists have begun to apply the terms “well” and “wellness” only to those who are actively striving to maintain and improve their health. People who are well are concerned with nutrition and exercise and they make a point of monitoring their body’s condition. Most important, perhaps, people who are well take active responsibility for all matters related to their health. Even people who have a physical disease or handicap (缺陷) may be "well," in this new sense, if they make an effort to maintain the best possible health they can in the face of their physical limitations. "Wellness" may perhaps best be viewed not as a state that people can achieve, but as an ideal that people can strive for. People who are well are likely to be better able to resist disease and to fight disease when it strikes. And by focusing attention on healthy ways of living, the concept of wellness can have a beneficial impact on the ways in which people face the challenges of daily life.62.Today medical care is placing more stress on ________.A. keeping people in a healthy physical conditionB. monitoring patients’ body functionsC. removing people’s bad living habitsD. ensuring people’s psychological well-being63. In the first paragraph, people are reminded that ________.A. good health is more than not being illB. drinking, even if not to excess, could be harmfulC. regular health checks are essential to keeping fitD. prevention is more difficult than cure64.Traditionally, a person is considered "well" if he ________.A. does not have any unhealthy living habitsB. does not have any physical handicapsC. is able to handle his daily routinesD. is free from any kind of disease65. According to the author, the true meaning of "wellness" is for people ________.A. to best satisfy their body’s special needsB. to strive to maintain the best possible healthC. to meet the strictest standards of bodily healthD. to keep a proper balance between work and leisure66. According to what the author advocates, which of the following groups of people would be considered healthy?A. People who have strong muscles as well as slim figures.B. People who are not presently experiencing any symptoms of disease.C. People who try to be as possible, regardless of their limitations.D. People who can recover from illness even without seeking medical care.完形填空Language is the most astonishing behavior in the animal kingdom. It is the species-typical behavior that sets humans completely   67   from all other animals. Language is a means of communication,   68   it is much more than that. Many animals can   69  . The dance of the honeybee communicates the location of flowers   70   other members of the hive(蜂群). But human language permits communication about anything.   71   things like unicorns(独角兽)that have never existed. The key    the fact that the units of meaning, words, can be   73   together in different ways, according to   74  , to communicate different meanings.Language is the most important learning we do. Nothing   75   humans so much as our ability to communicate abstract thoughts,   76   about  the university the mind, love, dreams, or ordering a drink, It is an immensely complex   77   that we take for granted. Indeed, we are not aware of most   78   of our speech and understanding. Consider what happens when one person is speaking to   79  . The Speaker has to translate thoughts into   80   language. Brain imaging studies suggest that the time from thoughts to the   81   of speech is extremely fast. Only 0.04 seconds! The listener must hear the sounds to   82   out what the speaker means. He must use the sounds of speech to   83   the words spoken, understand the pattern of   84   of the words (sentences), and finally   85   the meaning.

Its established status is being challenged by a growing number of people, especially by younger generations. It is increasingly difficult to cater for all tastes.

According to classroom teachers, elementary and middle school students who stay up late exhibit more learning and attention problems. This has been shown by    and  research. In the study, teachers were not told the amount of sleep students received when completing weekly performance reports, yet they rated the students who had received eight hours or less as having the most trouble recalling all the material，learning new lessons and completing high-quality work. Teachers also reported that these students had more difficulty paying attention. The experiment is the first to ask teachers to report on the effects of sleep deficiency in children. Just staying up late can cause increased academic difficulty and attention problems for otherwise healthy, well-functioning kids, said Garharn Forlone, the study’s lead author. So the results provide professionals and parents with a clear message: when a child is having learning and attention problems, the issue of sleep has to be taken into consideration. “If we don’t ask about sleep, and try to improve sleep patterns in kids’ struggling academically, then we aren’t doing our job”, Forlone said. For parents, he said, the message is simple, “getting kids to bed on time is as important as getting them to school on time”.　　Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard.　　Question 26: What were teachers told to do in the experiment?　　Question 27: According to the experiment, what problem can insufficient sleep cause in students?　　Question 28: What message did the researcher intend to convey to parents?Passage 2　　Patricia Pena never wanted to be a public figure. All she wanted to be was a mother and home-maker. But her life was turned upside down when a motorist, distracted by his cell phone, ran a stop sign and crashed into the side of her car. The impact killed her 2-year-old daughter. Four months later, Pena reluctantly but courageously decided to try to educate the public and to fight for laws to ban drivers from using cell phones while a car is moving. She wanted to save other children from what happened to her daughter. In her first speech, Pena got off to a shaky start. She was visibly trembling and her voice was soft and uncertain. But as she got into her speech, a dramatic transformation took place. She stopped shaking and spoke with a strong voice. For the rest of her talk, she was a forceful and compelling speaker. She wanted everyone in the audience to know what she knew without having to learn it from a personal tragedy. Many in the audience were moved to tears and to action. In subsequent presentations, Pena gained reputation as a highly effective speaker. Her appearance on a talk show was broadcast three times, transmitting her message to over 40 million people. Her campaign increased public awareness of the problem, and prompted over 300 cities and several states to consider restrictions on cell phone use.　　Questions 29 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.　　Question 29: What was the significant change in Patricia Pena’s life?　　Question 30: What had led to Pena’s personal tragedy?　　Question 31: How did Pena feel when she began her first speech?　　Question 32: What could be expected as a result of Pena’s efforts?Passage 3　　Many people catch a cold in the spring time or fall. It makes us wonder if scientists can send a man to the moon, why can’t they find a cure for the common cold. The answer is easy. There’re actually hundreds of kinds of cold viruses out there. You never know which one you will get, so there isn’t a cure for each one. When a virus attacks your body, your body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and causes a blockade in it. You feel terrible because you can’t breathe well, but your body is actually eating the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus. You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting into your cells. You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold. Different people have different remedies for colds. In the  and some other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot bath and drink warm liquids. Other people take medicines to relieve various symptoms of colds. There was one interesting thing to note. Some scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is actually bad for you. The virus stays in you longer, because your body doesn’t develop a way to fight it and kill it.　　Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.　　Question 33: According to the passage, why haven’t scientists found a cure for the common cold?　　Question 34: What does the speaker say about the symptoms of the common cold?Question 35: What do some scientists say about taking medicines for the common cold, according to the passage?2006年1月四级试题Part 1   			Listening Comprehension   			(20 minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, you will hear 10 short conversations.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B, C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.	Just five one-hundredths of an inch thick, light golden in color and with a perfect “saddle curl,” the Lay’s potato chip seems an unlikely weapon for global domination. But its maker, Frito-Lay, thinks otherwise.” Potato chips are a snack food for the world,” said  Salman Amin, the company’s head of global marketing. Amin believes there is no corner of the world that can resist the charms of a Frito-Lay potato chip.	Frito-Lay is the biggest snack maker in . owned by PepsiCo. And accounts for over half of the parent company’s $3 billion annual profits. But the  snack food market is largely saturated, and to grow, the company has to look overseas.	Its strategy rests on two beliefs: first, a global product offers economies of scale with which local brands cannot compete, and second, consumers in the 21st century are drawn to “global” as a concept. “Global” does not mean products that are consciously identified as American, but ones than consumers-especially young people-see as part of a modern, innovative (创新的) world in which people are linked across cultures by shared beliefs and tastes. Potato chips are an American invention, but most Chinese, for instance, do not know than Frito-Lay is an American company. Instead, Riskey, the company’s research and development head, would hope they associate the brand with the new world of global communications and business.	With brand perception a crucial factor, Riskey ordered a redesign of the Frito-Lay logo (标识).The logo, along with the company’s long-held marketing image of the “irresistibility” of its chips. would help facilitate the company’s global expansion.	The executives acknowledge that they try to swing national eating habits to a food created in , but they deny that amounts to economic imperialism. Rater, they see Frito-Lay as spreading the benefits of free enterprise across the world. “We’re making products in those countries, we’re adapting them to the tastes of those countries, building businesses and employing people and changing lives,” said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo’s chief executive.21. It is the belief of Frito-Lay’s head of global marketing that_____.A) Potato chips can hardly be used as a weapon to dominate the world marketB) Their company must find new ways to promote domestic sales.C) The light golden color enhances the charm of their company’s potato chipsD) People all over the world enjoy eating their company’s potato chips22. What do we learn about Frito-Lay from Paragraph 2?A) Its products used to be popular among overseas consumers.B) Its expansion has caused fierce competition in the snack marker.C) It gives half of its annual profits to its parent company.D) It needs to turn to the word market for development.23. One of the assumptions on which Frito-Lay bases its development strategy is that_____.A) consumers worldwide today are attracted by global brandsB) local brands cannot compete successfully with American brands C) products suiting Chinese consumers’ needs bring more profitsD) products identified as American will have promising market value 24. Why did Riskey have the Frito-Lay logo redesigned?A) To suit changing tastes of young consumers. B) To promote the company's strategy of globalization. C) To change the company’s long-held marketing image.D) To compete with other American chip producers.25. Frito-Lay's executives claim that the promoting of American food in the international market_____.A) won't affect the eating habits of the local people B) will lead to economic imperialismC) will be in the interest of the local peopleD) won’t spoil the taste of their chips Passage TwoQuestion 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.   In communities north of , residents are pitching in to help teachers and administrators as the  tries to solve a $13.8 million budget shortage blamed on mismanagement. ”We’re worried about our teachers and principals, and we really don’t want to lose them because of this,” one parent sail. “If we can help ease their financial burden, we will. ”   Teachers are grateful, but know it may be years before the district is solvent (有偿付能力的). They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it’s impossible for them to solve this problem.The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. “It’s extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,” said State Treasurer Mike Coffman.Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a $9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll (工资单) to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays.District officials also took $1.7 million from student-activity accounts in its 38schools.At Coffman’s request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district’s finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a $212 million bond issue for schools.In , students’ parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs.Some $36,000 has been raised in donations from Safeway. A Chevrolet dealership donated $10,000 and forgave the district’s $10,750 bill for renting the driver educating cars. IBM contributed 4,500 packs of paper.“We employ thousands of people in this community,” said Mitch Carson, a hospital chief executive, who helped raise funds. “We have children in the schools, and we see how they could be affected.”At Creek High School, three students started a website that displays newspaper articles, district information and an email forum (论坛).“Rumors about what’s happening to the district are moving at lighting speed,” said a student. “We wanted to know the truth, and spread that around instead.”26. What has happened to the ?A) A huge financial problem has arisen.B) Many schools there are mismanaged.C) Lots of teachers in the district are planning to quit.D) Many administrative personnel have been laid off.27. How did the residents in the  respond to the budget shortage?A) They felt somewhat helpless about it.B) They accused those responsible for it.C) They pooled their efforts to help solve it.D) They demanded a through investigation.28. In the view of State Treasurer Mike Coffman, the educational budget shortage is_________.A) unavoidable   B) unthinkable C) insolvable D) irreversible29. Why did Coffman request an investigation?A) To see if there was a deliberate cover-up of the problem.B) To find out the extent of the consequences of the case.C) To make sure that the school principals were innocent.D) To stop the voters approving the $212 million bond issue.30. Three high school students started a website in order to__________.A) attract greater public attention to their needsB) appeal to the public for contributions and donationsC) expose officials who neglected their dutiesD) keep people properly informed of the crisisPassage Three Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.“Humans should not try to avoid stress any more than they would shun food, love or exercise.” said Dr. Hans Selye, the first physician to document the effects of stress on the body. While here’s on question that continuous stress is harmful, several studies suggest that challenging situations in which you’re able to rise to the occasion can be good for you..In a 2001 study of 158 hospital nurses, those who faced considerable work demands but coped with the challenge were more likely to say they were in good health than those who felt they couldn’t get the job done.Stress that you can manage may also boost immune (免疫的)  function. In a study at the   for Dentistry in , researchers put volunteers through two stressful experiences. In the first, a timed task that required memorizing a list followed by a short test, subjects believed they had control over the outcome. In the second, they weren’t in control: They had to sit through a gory (血淋淋的) video on surgical procedures. Those who did well on the memory test had an increase in levels of immunoglobulin A, an antibody that’s the body’s first line of defense against germs. The video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody.Stress prompts the body to produce certain stress hormones. In short bursts these hormones have a positive effect, including improved memory function. “They can help nerve cells handle information and put it into storage,” says Dr. Bruce McEwen of   in . But in the long run these hormones can have a harmful effect on the body and brain.“Sustained stress is not good for you,” says Richard Morimoto, a researcher at Northwestern University in Illinois studying the effects of stress on longevity (长寿), “It’s the occasional burst of stress or brief exposure to stress that could be protective.”31. The passage is mainly about______	A) the benefits of manageable stress	B) how to avoid stressful situations	C) how to cope with stress effectively	D) the effects of stress hormones on memory32. The word “shun”(Line 1,Para.1) most probably means________.	A) cut down on	B) stay away from	C) run out of	D) put up with33. We can conclude from the study of the 158 nurses in 2001 that_______	A) people under stress tend to have a poor memory	B) people who can’t get their job done experience more stress	C) doing challenging work may be good for one’s health	D) stress will weaken the body’s defense against germs34. In the experiment described in Paragraph 3,the video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody because______.	A) the video was not enjoyable at all	B) the outcome was beyond their control 	C) they knew little about surgical procedures	D) they felt no pressure while watching the video35. Dr. Bruce McEwen of  believes that______.	A) a person’s memory is determined by the level of hormones in his body	B) stress hormones have lasting positive effects on the brain	C) short bursts of stress hormones enhance memory function	D) a person’s memory improves with continued experience of stress.Passage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.If you want to teach your children how to say sorry, you must be good at saying it yourself, especially to your own children. But how you say it can be quite tricky.	If you say to your children “I’m sorry I got angry with you, but …” what follows that “but” can render the apology ineffective:” I had a bad day” or “your noise was giving me a headache ” leaves the person who has been injured feeling that he should be apologizing for his bad behavior in expecting an apology.	Another method by which people appear to apologize without actually doing so is to say “I’m sorry you’re upset” ; this suggests that you are somehow at fault for allowing  yourself to get upset by what the other person has done.	Then there is the general, all covering apology, which avoids the necessity of identifying a specific act that was particularly hurtful or insulting, and which the person who is apologizing  should promise never to do again. Saying “I’m useless as a parent” does not commit a person to any specific improvement.	These pseudo-apologies are used by people who believe saying sorry shows weakness. Parents who wish to teach their children to apologize should see it as a sign of strength, and therefore not resort to these pseudo-apologies.	But even when presented with examples of genuine contrition (悔悟), children still need help to become aware of the complexities of saying sorry. A three-year-old might need help in understanding that other children feel pain just as he does, and that hitting a playmate over the head with a heavy toy requires an apology. A six-year-old might need reminding that spoiling other children’s expectations can require an apology. A 12-year-old might need to be shown that raiding the biscuit tin without asking permission is acceptable, but that borrowing a parent’s clothes without permission is not.36. If a mother adds ”but” to an apology,________.	A) she doesn’t feel that she should have apologized.	B) she does not realize that the child has been hurt	C) the child may find the apology easier to accept	D) the child may feel that he owes her an apology37. According to the author, saying “I’m sorry you’re upset” most probably means”_______”	A) You have good reason to get upset	B) I’m aware you’re upset ,but I’m not to blame	C) I apologize for hurting your feelings	D) I’m at fault for making you upset38. It is not advisable to use the general, all-covering apology because______.	A) it gets one into the habit of making empty promises	B) it may make the other person feel guiltyC)it is vague and ineffective D) it is hurtful and insulting39. We learn from the last paragraph that in teaching children to say sorry______.	A) the complexities involved should be ignored	B) their ages should be taken into account	C) parents need to set them a good example	D) parents should be patient and tolerant40. It can be inferred from the passage that apologizing properly is _________.	A) a social issue calling for immediate attention	B) not necessary among family members	C) a sign of social progress	D) not as simple as it seems Part III    					Vocabulary   				 (20minutes)Directions: there are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Then mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.	As a physician who travels quite a lot, I spend a lot of time on planes listening for that dreaded “Is there a doctor on board?” announcement. I’ve been   71   only once – for a woman who had merely fainted. But the   72   made me quite curious about how   73   this kind of thing happens. I wondered what I would do if  74  with a real midair medical emergency-without access    hospital staff and the usual emergency equipment. So   76 the New England Journal of Medicine last week    study about in–flight medical events. I read it   78   interest.	The study estimated that there are a(n)   79   of -flight medical emergencies on  flights every day. Most of them are not   80  ; fainting and dizziness are the most frequent complaints.   81   13% of them –roughly four a day – are serious enough to    pilot to change course. The most common of the serious emergencies   83   heart trouble, strokes, and difficulty breathing.	Let’s face it: plane rides are   84  . For starters, cabin pressures at high altitudes are set at roughly  85   they would be if you lived at 5,000 to 8,000 feet above sea level. Most people can tolerate these pressures pretty   86  , but passengers with heart disease   87   experience chest pains as a result of the reduced amount of oxygen flowing through their blood.    88 common in-flight problem is deep venous thrombosis – the so-called economy class syndrome (综合症).   89   happens, don’t panic. Things are getting better on the in-flight-emergency front. Thanks to more recent legislation, flights with at   90   one attendant are starting to install emergency medical kits to treat heart attacks71.

The doctors who carried out this study say giving aspirin to patients soon after the operation could save thousands of lives. People usually take aspirin to control pain and reduce high body temperature. Doctors also advise some people to take aspirin to help prevent heart attacks. About 10-15 percent of these heart operations end in death or damage to the heart or other organs. The new study shows that even a small amount of aspirin reduced such threats. The doctors said the chance of death for patients who tool aspirin would fall by 67%. They claimed this was true if the aspirin was given within 48 hours of the operation. The doctors believe aspirin helps heart surgery patients because it can prevent blood from thickening and blood vessels from being blocked. However, the doctors warned that people who have stomach bleeding or other bad reactions from aspirin should not take it after heart surgery.Q11. What is the finding of the new study of aspirin?Q12. In what way can aspirin help heart surgery patients according to the doctors?Q13. What warning did the doctors give about the use of aspirin?Passage TwoWere you the first or the last child in you family? Or were you a middle or an only child? Some people think it matters where you were born in you family. But there are different ideas about what birth order means. Some people say that oldest children are smart and strong-willed. They are very likely to be successful. The reason for this simple parents have a lot of time for their first child, they give him or her a lot of attention. So this child is very likely to do well. An only child will succeed for the same reason. What happens to the other children in the family? Middle children don’t get so much attention, so they don’t feel that important. If a family has many children, the middle one sometimes gets lost in the crowd. The youngest child, though, often gets special treatment. He or she is the baby. Often this child grows up to be funny and charming. Do you believe this idea of birth order too? A recent study saw things quite differently. The study found that first children believed in family rules. They didn’t take many chances in their lives. They usually followed orders. Rules didn’t mean as much to later children in the family. They went out and followed their own ideas. They took chances and they often did better in life.Q14. According to common belief, in what way are the first child and the only child alike?Q15. What do people usually say about middle children?Q16. what do we learn about later children in a family from a recent study of birth order?Passage Three When my interest shifted from space to the sea, I never expected it would cause such confusion among my friends, yet I can understand their feelings. As I have been writing and talking about space flight for the best part of 20 years, a sudden switch of interest to the depth of the sea doer seem peculiar. To explain, I’d like to share my reasons behind this unusual change of mind. The first excuse I give is an economic one. Underwater exploration is so much cheaper than space flight. The first round-trip ticket to the moon is going to cost at least 10 billion dollars if you include research and development. By the end of this century, the cost will be down to a few million. On the other hand, the diving suit and a set of basic tools needed for skin-diving can be bought for 20 dollars. My second argument is more philosophical. The ocean, surprisingly enough, has many things in common with space. In their different ways, both sea and space are equally hostile. If we wish to survive in either for any length of time, we need to have mechanical aids. The diving suit helped the design of the space suit. The feeling and the emotions of a man beneath the sea will be much like those of a man beyond the atmosphere.Q17. How did the speaker’s friends respond to his change of interest?Q18. What is one of the reasons for the spears to switch his interest to underwater exploration?Q19. In what way does the speaker think diving is similar to space travel?Q20. What is the speaker’s purpose in giving this talk?21.D  22.D  23.A  24. B	25.C  26.A  27.C  28.B  29.A  30.D31.A  32.B  33.C  34. B  35.C  36.D  37.B  38.C  39.B  40.D41.C  42.B 	43.A  44.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.Educating girls quite possibly yields a higher rate of return than any other investment available in the developing world. Women’s education may be unusual territory for economists, but enhancing women’s contribution to development is actually as much an economic as a social issue. And economics, with its emphasis on incentives (激励), provides guideposts that point to an explanation for why so many girls are deprived of an education.Parents in low-income countries fail to invest in their daughters because they do not expect them to make an economic contribution to the family: girls grow up only to marry into somebody else’s family and bear children. Girls are thus seen as less valuable than boys and are kept at home to do housework while their brothers are sent to school-the prophecy (预言) becomes self-fulfilling, trapping women in a vicious circle (恶性循环) of neglect.An educated mother, on the other hand, has greater earning abilities outside the home and faces an entirely different set of choices. She is likely to have fewer but healthier children and can insist on the development of all her children, ensuring that her daughters are given a fair chance. The education of her daughters then makes it much more likely that the next generation of girls, as well as of boys, will be educated and healthy. The vicious circle is thus transformed into a virtuous circle.Few will dispute that educating women has great social benefits. But it has enormous economic advantages as well. Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers. Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling. Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available investments, but they are just the beginning. Educating women also has a significant impact on health practices, including family planning.21. The author argues that educating girls in developing countries is _________.	A) rewarding		B) troublesome		C) expensive		D) labor-saving22. By saying “…the prophecy becomes self-fulfilling…” (Lines 4-5, Para. 2), the author means that __________.	A) girls will eventually find their goals in life beyond reach	B) girls will be increasingly discontented with their life at home	C) girls will be capable of realizing their own dreams	D) girls will turn out to be less valuable than boys23. The author believes that a vicious circle can turn into a virtuous circle when ________	A) women care more about education	B) parents can afford their daughters’ education	C) girls can gain equal access to education	D) a family has fewer but healthier children24. What does the author say about women’s education?	A) It has aroused the interest of a growing number of economists.	B) It will yield greater returns than other known investments.	C) It is now given top priority in many developing countries.	D) It deserves greater attention than other social issues.25. The passage mainly discusses __________.	A) unequal treatment of boys and girls in developing countries	B) the major contributions of educated women to society	C) the economic and social benefits of educating women	D) the potential earning power of well-educated womenPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.Psychiatrists (精神病专家) who work with older parents say that maturity can be an asset in child rearing ---- older parents are more thoughtful, use less physical discipline and spend more time with their children. But raising kids takes money and energy. Many older parents find themselves balancing their limited financial resources, declining energy and failing health against the growing demands of an active child. Dying and leaving young children is probably the older parents’ biggest, and often unspoken, fear. Having late-life children, says an economics professor, often means parents, particularly fathers, “end up retiring much later.” For many, retirement becomes an unobtainable dream.Henry Metcalf, a 54-year-old journalist, knows it takes money to raise kids. But he’s also worried that his energy will give out first. Sure, he can still ride bikes with his athletic fifth grader, but he’s learned that young at heart doesn’t mean young. Lately he’s been taking afternoon naps (午睡) to keep up his energy. “My body is aging,” says Metcalf, “You can’t get away from that.”Often, older parents hear the ticking of another kind of biological clock. Therapists who work with middle-aged and older parents say fears about aging are nothing to laugh at. “They worry they’ll be mistaken for grandparents, or that they’ll need help getting up out of those little chairs in nursery school,” says Joann Galst, a  psychologist. But at the core of those little fears there is often a much bigger one: “that they won’t be alive long enough to support and protect their child,” she says.Many late-life parents, though, say their children came at just the right time. After marrying late and undergoing years of fertility (受孕) treatment, Marilyn Nolen and her husband, Randy, had twins. “We both wanted children,” says Marilyn, who was 55 when she gave birth. The twins have given the couple what they desired for years, “a sense of family.”Kids of older dads are often smarter, happier and more sociable because their fathers are more involved in their lives. “The dads are older, more mature,” says Dr. Silber, “and more ready to focus on parenting.”26. Why do psychiatrists regard maturity as an asset in child rearing?	A) Older parents can better balance their resources against children’s demands.	B) Older parents are usually more experienced in bringing up their children.	C) Older parents are often better prepared financially.	D) Older parents can take better care of their children.27. What does the author mean by saying “For many, retirement becomes an unobtainable dream” (Lines 7-8, Para. 1)?	A) They have to go on working beyond their retirement age.	B) They can’t get full pension unless they work some extra years.	C) They can’t obtain the retirement benefits they have dreamed of.	D) They are reluctant to retire when they reach their retirement age.28. The author gives the example of Henry Metcalf to show that _________.	A) many people are young in spirit despite their advanced age	B) taking afternoon naps is a good way to maintain energy	C) older parents tend to be concerned about their aging bodies	D) older parents should exercise more to keep up with their athletic children.29. What’s the biggest fear of older parents according to  psychologist Joann Galst?	A) Being laughed at by other people.	B) Slowing down of their pace of life.	C) Being mistaken for grandparents.	D) Approaching of death.30. What do we learn about Marilyn and Randy Nolen?	A) They thought they were an example of successful fertility treatment.	B) Not until they had the twins did they feel they had formed a family.	C) They believed that children born of older parents would be smarter.	D) Not until they reached middle age did they think of having children.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.Interest in pursuing international careers has soared in recent years, enhanced by chronic (长久的) personnel shortages that are causing companies to search beyond their home borders for talent.Professionals seek career experience outside of their home countries for a variety of reasons. They may feel the need to recharge their batteries with a new challenge. They may want a position with more responsibility that encourages creativity and initiative. Or they may wish to expose their children to another culture, and the opportunity to learn a second language.When applying for a job, one usually has to submit a resume or curriculum vitae (CV). The two terms generally mean the same thing: a one-or two-page document describing one’s educational qualifications and professional experience. However, guidelines for preparing a resume are constantly changing. The best advice is to find out what is appropriate regarding the corporate (公司的) culture, the country culture, and the culture of the person making the hiring decision. The challenge will be to embrace two or more cultures in one document. The following list is a good place to start.Educational requirements differ from country to country. In almost every case of “cross-border” job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not be an adequate description. Provide the reader with details about your studies and any related experience.Pay attention to the resume format you use---chronological or reverse-chronological order. Chronological order means listing your “oldest” work experience first. Reverse-chronological order means listing your current or most recent experience first. Most countries have preferences about which format is most acceptable. If you find no specific guidelines, the general preference is for the reverse-chronological format.If you are submitting your resume in English, find out if the recipient (收件人) uses British English or American English because there are variations between the two versions. For example, university education is often referred to as “tertiary education” in the , but this term is almost never used in the . A reader who is unfamiliar with these variations may assume that your resume contains errors.31. Companies are hiring more foreign employees because___________.	A) they have difficulty finding qualified personnel at home.	B) they find foreign employees are usually more talented	C) the need original ideas from employees hired overseas	D) they want to expand their business beyond home borders32. The author believes that an individual who applies to work overseas ___________.	A) is usually creative and full of initiative	B) aims to improve his foreign language skills	C) seeks either his own or his children’s development	D) is dissatisfied with his own life at home33. When it comes to resume writing, it is best to __________	A) know the employer’s personal likes and dislikes	B) follow appropriate guidelines for job hunting	C) learn about the company’s hiring process	D) take cultural factors into consideration34. When writing about qualifications, applicants are advised to ________.	A) provide a detailed description of their study and work experiences	B) give the title of the university degree they have earned at home	C) highlight their keen interest in pursuing a “cross-border” career	D) stress their academic potential to impress the decision maker35. 	According to the author’s last piece of advice, the applicants should be aware of ________	A) the recipient’s preference with regard to the formatB) the different educational systems in the  and the C) the differences between the varieties of English D) the distinctive features of American and British culturesPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.Speeding off in a stolen car, the thief thinks he has got a great catch. But he is in for an unwelcome surprise. The car is fitted with a remote immobiliser (锁止器), and a radio signal from a control centre miles away will ensure that once the thief switches the engine off, he will not be able to start it again.The idea goes like this. A control box fitted to the car contains a mini-cellphone, a microprocessor and memory, and a GPS (全球定位系统) satellite positioning receiver. If the car is stolen, a coded cellphone signal will tell the control centre to block the vehicle’s engine management system and prevent the engine being restarted.In the  a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves. “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed,” says Martyn Randall, a security expert. He says it would only take him a few minutes to teach a person how to steal a car, using a bare minimum of tools. But only if the car is more than 10 years old.Modern cars are far tougher to steal, as their engine management computer won’t allow them to start unless they receive a unique ID code beamed out by the ignition (点火) key. In the , technologies like this have helped achieve a 31% drop in vehicle-related crime since 1997.But determined criminals are still managing to find other ways to steal cars, often by getting hold of the owner’s keys. And key theft is responsible for 40% of the thefts of vehicles fitted with a tracking system.If the car travels 100 metres without the driver confirming their ID, the system will send a signal to an operations centre that it has been stolen. The hundred metres minimum avoids false alarms due to inaccuracies in the GPS signal.Staff at the centre will then contact the owner to confirm that the car really is missing, and keep police informed of the vehicle’s movements via the car’s GPS unit.36. What’s the function of the remote immobiliser fitted to a car?	A) To allow the car to lock automatically when stolen.	B) To prevent the car thief from restarting it once it stops.	C) To help the police make a surprise attack on the car thief.	D) To prevent car theft by sending a radio signal to the car owner.37. By saying “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed” (Lines 1-2, Para.3), Martyn Randall suggests that _________.	A) self-prepared tools are no longer enough for car theft	B) the thief has to make use of computer technology	C) it takes a longer time for the car thief to do the stealing	D) the thief has lost interest in stealing cars over 10 years old38. What is essential in making a modern car tougher to steal?	A) A GPS satellite positioning receiver	B) A unique ID card	C) A special cellphone signal	D) A coded ignition key39. Why does the tracking system set a 100-metre minimum before sending an alarm to the operations centre?	A) To give the driver time to contact the operations centre	B) To allow for possible errors in the GPS system	C) To keep police informed of the car’s movements	D) To leave time for the operations centre to give an alarm40. What will the operations centre do first after receiving an alarm?  	A) Start the tracking system.	B) Locate the missing car.	C) Contact the car owner.	D) Block the car engine.Part III               Vocabulary               (20 minutes)Directions: There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Then mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.The part of the environmental movement that draws my firm’s attention is the design of cities, buildings and products. When we designed ’s first so-called “green” office building in  two decades    71   , we felt very alone. But today, thousands of people come to green building conferences, and the    72   that buildings can be good for people and the environment will be increasingly influential in years to    73   .Back in 1984 we discovered that most manufactured products for decoration weren’t designed for    74   use. The “energy-efficient” sealed commercial buildings constructed after the 1970s energy crisis    75   indoor air quality problems caused by materials such as paint, wall covering and carpet. So for 20 years, we’ve been focusing on these materials    76   to the molecules, looking for ways to make them    77    for people and the planet.Home builders can now use materials----such as paints that release significantly   78   amounts of organic compounds ----that don’t    79   the quality of the air, water, or soil. Ultimately,   80   , our basic design strategy is focused not simply on being “less bad” but on creating    81   healthful materials that can be either safely returned to the soil   82   reused by industry again and again. As a matter of    83  , the world’s largest carpet manufacturer has already     carpet that is fully and safely recyclable (可循环利用的).Look at it this way: No one    85   out to create a building that destroys the planet. But our current industrial systems are    86   causing these conditions, whether we like it or not. So    87   of simply trying to reduce the damage, we are     positive approach. We’re giving people high-quality, healthful products and an opportunity to make choices that have a    89   effect on the world.It’s not just the building industry, either,   90   cities are taking these environmentally positive approaches to design, planning and building. ,  and  have said they want to be green cities.  wants to be the greenest city in the world.71.

Section BPassage 1　　Unless you have visited the southern , you probably have never heard of Kudzu. Kudzu, as any farmer in the south will sadly tell you, is a super-powered weed. It is a strong climbing plant. Once it gets started, Kudzu is almost impossible to stop. It climbs to the tops of the tallest trees. It can cover large buildings. Whole barns and farm houses have been known to disappear from view. Wherever it grows, its thick twisting stems are extremely hard to remove. Kudzu was once thought to be a helpful plant. Originally found in Asia, it was brought to  to help protect the land from being swallowed by the sea. It was planted where its tough roots which grow up to five feet long could help hold back the soil. But the plant soon spread to places where it wasn't wanted. Farmers now have to fight to keep it from killing other plants. In a way, Kudzu is a sign of labor shortage in the south. Where there is no one to work the fields, Kudzu soon takes over. The northern  faces no threat from Kudzu. Harsh winters kill it off. The plant loves the warmth of the south, but the south surely doesn't love it. If someone could invent some use for Kudzu and remove it from southern farmland, his or her fortune would be assured.　　11. What do we learn about “Kudzu” from the passage?　　12. What will happen if the fields are neglected in the southern ? 　　13. Why isn't Kudzu a threat to the northern ?Passage 2　　The word “university” comes from the Latin word “universities”, meaning “the whole”. Later, in Latin legal language, “universities” meant a society or corporation. In the Middle Ages, the word meant “ an association of teachers and scholars”. The origins of universities can be traced back to the 12th to14th centuries. In the early 12th century, long before universities were organized in the modern sense, students gathered together for higher studies at certain centers of learning. The earliest centers in the Europe were at Bolonia in , founded in 1088. Other early centers were set up in , the  ,  and  from 1150 to 1386. The first universities in  were  and . They were established in 1185 and 1209 respectively. The famous  was founded in 1836. This was followed by the foundation of several universities such as  and , which developed from provincial colleges. It was in the 1960's that the largest expansion of higher education took place in . This expansion took 3 basic forms: existing universities were enlarged, new universities were developed from existing colleges and completely new universities were set up. In , finance for universities comes from three source: the first, and the largest source, is grants from the government, the second source is fees paid by students and the third one is private donations. All the British universities except one receive some government funding. The exception is Buckingham, which is 's only independent university.　　14. What did the word "Universities" mean in the Middle Ages?　　15. Why was the 1960s so significant for British Higher Education?　　16. What is the main financial source for British universities?Passage 3　　One of the biggest problems in developing countries is hunger. An organization called Heifer International is working to improve the situation. The organization sends farm animals to families and communities around the world. An American farmer Dan West developed the idea for Heifer International in the 1930s. Mr. West was working in  where he discovered a need for cows. Many families were starving because of the Civil War in that country. So Mr. West asked his friends in the Unites States to send some cows. The first Heifer animals were sent in 1944. Since that time more than 4 million people in 115 countries have had better lives because of heifer animals. To receive a Heifer animal, families must first explain their needs and goals. They must also make a plan which will allow them to become self-supporting. Local experts usually provide training. The organization says that animals must have food, water, shelter, health care and the ability to reproduce. Without them, the animals will not remain healthy and productive. Heifer International also believes that families must pass on some of their success to others in need. This belief guarantees that each person who takes part in the program also becomes a giver. Every family that receives a Heifer animal must agree to give that animal's first female baby to other people in need. Families must also agree to pass on the skills and training they receive from Heifer International. This concept helps communities become self-supporting.17: What does the speaker tell us about Mr. West?18: What is the ultimate goal of Heifer International?19: What are families required to do after they receive support from Heifer International?20: What is the major achievement of Heifer International?1.

For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.Univeraities Branch Out     As never before in their long story, universities have become instruments of national competition as well as instruments of peace. They are the place of the scientific discoveries that move economies forward, and the primary means of educating the talent required to obtain and maintain competitive advantages. But at the same time, the opening of national borders to the flow of goods, services, information and especially people has made universities a powerful force for global integration, mutual understanding and geopolitical stability.   In response to the same forces that have driven the world economy, universities have become More self-consciousy global: seeking students from around the world who represent the entire range of cultures and values, sending their own students abroad to prepare them for global careers, offering courses of study that address the challenges of an interconnected world and collaborative（合作的）research programs to advance science for the benefit of all humanity.Of the forces shaping higher education none is more sweeping than the movement across borders. Over the past three decades the number of students leaving home each year to study abroad has grown at an annual rate of 3.0 percent, from  1975 to 2.5 million in 2994. Most travel from one developed nation to another, but the flow from developing to developed countries id growing rapidly. The reverse flow, from developed to developing countries, is on the rise, too. Today foreign students earn 30 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in the  and 38 percent of those in the . And the number crossing borders for undergraduate study is growing as well, to 8 percent of the undergraduates at ’s best institutions and 10 percent of all undergraduates in the  In the , 20 percent of the newly hired professors in science and engineering are foreign-born, and in  many newly hired faculty hired faculty members at the top research universities received their graduate education abroad.	Universities are also encouraging students to spend some of their undergraduate years in another country. In , more than 140,000 students participate in the Erasmus program each year, taking courses for credit in one of 2, 2000 participating institutions across the continent. And in the United States, institutions are helping place students in summer internships（实习）abroad to prepare them for global careers. Yale and Harvard have led the way, offering every undergraduate at least one international study or internship opportunity and providing the financial resources to make it possible.Globalization is also reshaping the way research is done. One new trend involves sourcing portions of a research program to another country. Yale professor and Howard Hughes Medical Shanghai’s , in collaboration with faculty colleagues from both schools. The  center has 95 employees and graduate students working in a 4,300-square-meter laboratory seminars with scientists from both campuses. The arrangement benefits both countries;Xu’s Yale lab is more productive, thanks to the lower costs of conducing from a word-class scientist and his  team.As a result of its strength in science, the United States has consistently led of the world in the world in the commercialization of major new technologies, from the mainframe computer and integrated circuit of the 1960s to the internet infrastructure(基础设施)and applications software of the 1990s.The link between university-based science and industrial application is often indirect but sometimes highly visible: Silicon Valley was intentionally created by , andRoute 128 outside  has long housed companies spun off from MIT and Harvard. Around the world ,governments have encouraged copying of his model, perhaps most successfully in Cambridge, England, where Microsoft and scores of other leading software and biotechnology companies have set up shop around the university.For all its success, the  remains deeply hesitant about sustaining the research university model. Most politician recognize the link between investment in science and national Economic strength, but support for research funding has been unsteady. The budget of the National Institutes of Health doubled between 1998 and 2003,but has risen more slowly than inflations since then. Support for the physical sciences and engineering barely kept pace with inflation during that same period. The attempt to make up lost ground is welcome, but the nation would be better served by steady, predictable increases in science funding at the rate of long-term GDP growth, which is on the order of inflation plus 3 percent per year.American politicians have great difficulty recognizing that admitting more foreign students can greatly promote the national interest by increasing international understanding. Adjusted for inflation, public funding for international exchanges and foreign-language study is well below the levels of 40 years ago. In the wake of September 11,changes in the visa process caused a dramatic decline in the number of foreign students seeking admission to U.S. Universities, and a corresponding surge in enrollments in Australia, Singapore and the U .K. Objections from Americans university and business leaders led to improvements in the process and a reversal of the decline ,but the United States is still seen by many as unwelcoming to international students.Most Americans recognize that universities contribute to the nation’s well-being through their scientific research, but many fear that foreign students threaten American competitiveness by taking their knowledge and skills back home. They fail to grasp that welcoming foreign students and like immigrants throughout history-strength the nation; and second, foreign students who study in the United States become ambassadors for many of its most cherished(珍视) values when they return home. Or at least they understand them better. In  as elsewhere, few Instruments of foreign policy are as effective in promoting peace and stability as welcoming international university students.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。1From the first paragraph we know that present –day universities have become           A．more and more research-oriented			B．in-service training organizationsC．more popularized than ever before			D．a powerful force for global integration2．Over the past three decades, the enrollment of overseas students has increased         A．by2.5 million	B．by 800,000	C．at an annual rate of 3.9 percentD．at an annual rate of 8 percent3．In the ,how many of the newly hired professors in science and engineering are foreign-born?A．10%	B．20%	C．30%	D．38%4．How do Yale and Harvard prepare their undergraduates for global careers?A．They organize a series of seminars on world economyB．They offer them various courses in international politicsC．They arrange for them to participate in the Erasmus programD．They give them chances for international study or internship5．An example illustrating the general trend of universities’ globalization is                 A．Yale’s collaboration with  on genetic researchB．Yale’s helping Chinese universities to launch research projectsC．Yale’s student exchange program with European institutionsD．Yale’s establishing branch campuses throughout the world6．What do we learn about  from the passage?A．It houses many companies spun off from MIT and HarvardB．It is known to be the birthplace of Microsoft CompanyC．It was intentionally created by D．It is where the Internet infrastructure was built up7．What is said about the  federal funding for research?A．It has increased by 3 percent		B．It has been unsteady for years		C．It has been more than sufficient		D．It doubled between 1998 and 20038．The dramatic decline in the enrollment of foreign students in the U.S after September 11 was caused by             9．Many Americans fear that American competiveness may be threatened by foreign students who will           10The policy of welcoming foreign students can benefit the  in that the very best of them will stay and              Part Ⅲ          Listening Comprehension               (35 minutes)Section ADirection: In his section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.

If you doubt the popularity of the trend, you probably haven’t . It enrolls 90,000 student , a statistic used to support its claim to be the largest private university in the country.While the kinds of instruction offered in these programs will differ, DL usually signifies a course in which the instructions post syllabi(课程大纲), reading assignments , and schedules on Websites , and students send in their assignments by e-mail . Generally speaking , face-to-face communication with an instructor is minimized or eliminated altogether.The attraction for students might at first seem obvious . Primarily , there’s the convenience promised by courses on the Net: you can do the work, as they say , in your pajamas(睡衣). But figures indicate that the reduced effort results in a reduced commitment to the course . While dropout rates for all freshmen at American universities is around 20 percent , the rate for online students is 35 percent . Students themselves seem to understand the weaknesses inherent in the setup . In a survey conducted for eCornell , the DL division of  , less than a third of the respondents expected the quality of the online course to be as good as the classroom course.Cleary form the schools perspective , there’s a lot of money to be saved . Although some of the more ambitious programs require new investments in servers and networks to support collaborative software , most DL courses can run on existing or minimally upgraded(升级)systems . The more students who enroll in a course but don’t come to campus , the more the school saves on keeping the lights on in the classrooms , paying doorkeepers , and maintaining parking lots , And there’s evindence that instructors must work harder to run a DL course for a variety of reasons , won’t be paid any more , and might well be paid less.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。57.

Yet, despite the competition, my 8-year-old daughter Rebecca wants to spend her leisure time writing short stories. She wants to enter one of her stories into a writing contest, a competition she won last yes.As a writer I know about winning contest, and about losing them. I know what it is like to work hard on a story only to receive a rejection slip from the publisher. I also know the pressures of trying to live up to a reputation created by previous victories. What if she doesn’t win the contest again? That’s the strange thing about being a parent. So many of our own past scars and dashed hopes can surface.A revelation（启示）came last week when I asked her, “Don’t you want to win again?” “No,” she replied, “I just want to tell the story of an angel going to first grade.”I had just spent weeks correcting her stories as she spontaneously（自由地）told them. Telling myself that I was merely an experienced writer guiding the young writer across the hall, I offered suggestions for characters, conflicts and endings for her tales. The story about a fearful angel starting first trade was quickly “guided” by me into the tale of a little girl with a wild imagination taking her fist music lesson. I had turned her contest into my contest without even realizing it.Staying back and giving kids space to grow is not as easy as it looks. Because I konw very little about farm animals who use tools or angels who go to first grade, I had to accept the fact that I was co-opting（借用）my daughter’s experence.   While stepping back was difficult for me, it was certainly a good first step that I will quickly follow with more steps, putting myself far enough away to give her room but close enough to help if asked. All the while I will be reminding myself that children need room to experiment, grow and find their own voices.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。62. What do we learn from the first paragraph?

We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus on attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home, Internet, and direct mail.TelevisionTelevision in an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication. But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it.Television’s influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. the Golf Channel, for instance, is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous (具有共同特点的) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers. This had also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.NewspapersAfter television, the medium attracting the next largest annual as revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually. It has increased its national circulation (发行量) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in 168 cities. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium.Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer, more detailed message to their audience than they can through television. Given new production techniques, advertisements can be printed in about 48 hours, meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the message out. Newspapers are often the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local readers.RadioAdvertising on radio continues to grow. Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor bill-boards (广告牌) and the Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeat their ads often. Internet companies are also turning to radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day. Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.Two major changes—satellite and Internet radio—will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart.MagazinesNewsweeklies, women’s titles, and business magazines have all seen increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market. Magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television attracts all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous. If you read Sports Illustrated, for example, you have such in common with the magazine’s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.Advertisers using the print media—magazines and newspapers—will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the Internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers. These audiences will be more diverse and geographically dispersed (分散) than in the past. Second, advertisers will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.Out-of-home advertisingOut-of-home advertising, also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly effective way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for advertising is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective. Technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past. Using the digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they can change their messages more quickly.InternetAs consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market. As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease. The challenge to Internet advertisers is to create ads that audience members remember.Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations’ advertising in the near future. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the inline medium as well.Direct mailA final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client’s message. Direct mail includes newsletters, postcards, and special promotion. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers. For many businesses, direct mail is the most effective form of advertising.1.

I had been abroad a couple of times, but I could hardly _47_ to know my way around the continent. Moreover, my knowledge of foreign languages was _48_ to a little college French.I hesitated. How would I, unable to speak the language, _49_ unfamiliar with local geography or transportation systems, set up _50_ and do research? It seemed impossible, and with considerable _51_ I sat down to write a letter begging off. Halfway through, a thought can through my mind: you can learn if you don’t try. So I accepted the assignment.There were some bad _52_. But by the time I had finished the trip I was an experienced traveler. And ever since, I have never hesitated to head for even the most remote of places, without guiders or even _53_ bookings, confident that somehow I will manage.The point is that the new, the different, is almost by definition _54_. But each time you try something, you learn, and as the learning piles up, the world opens to you.I’ve learned to ski at 40, and flown up the  in a _55_. And I know I’ll go on doing such things. It’s not because I’m braver or more daring than others. I’m not. But I’ll accept anxiety as another name for challenge and I believe I can _56_ wonders.A) accomplishB) advancedC) balloonD) claimE) constantlyF) declareG) interviewsH)limitedI) manufactureJ) momentsK) newsL) reducedM) regretN) scaryO) totallySection BPassage OneGlobal warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the 21st century, but regardless of whether it is or isn’t –we won’t do much about it.  We will argue over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed.Al Gore calls global warming an “inconvenient truth,” as if merely recognizing it could put us on a path to a solution. But the real truth is that we don’t know enough to relieve global warming, and –without major technological breakthroughs—we can’t do much about it.From 2003 to 2050, the world’s population is projected to grow from 6.4 billion to 9.1 billion, a 42% increase. If energy use per person and technology remain the same, total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (mainly, CO2) will be 42% higher in 2050. but that’s too low, because societies that grow richer use more energy. We need economic growth unless we condemn the world’s poor to their present poverty and freeze everyone else’s living standards. With modest growth, energy use and greenhouse emissions more than double by 2050.No government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and personal freedom (limits on electricity usage, driving and travel) that might cut back global warming. Still, politicians want to show they’re “doing something.” Consider the Kyoto Protocol (京都议定书). It allowed countries that joined to punish those that didn’t. But it hasn’t reduced CO2 emissions (up about 25% since 1990), and many signatories (签字国) didn’t adopt tough enough policies to hit their 2008-2012 targets.The practical conclusion is that if global warming is a potential disaster, the only solution is new technology. Only an aggressive research and development program might find ways of breaking dependence on fossil fuels or dealing with it.The trouble with the global warming debate is that it has become a moral problem when it’s really an engineering one. The inconvenient truth is that if we don’t solve the engineering problem, we’re helpless.57. What is said about global warming in the first paragraph?A) It may not prove an environmental crisis at all. B) It is an issue requiring world wide commitments.C) Serious steps have been taken to avoid or stop it.D) Very little will be done to bring it under control.58. According to the author’s understanding, what is Al Gore’s view on global warming?A) It is a reality both people and politicians are unaware of.B) It is a phenomenon that causes us many inconveniences.C) It is a problem that can be solved once it is recognized.D) It is an area we actually have little knowledge about.59. Green house emissions will more than double by 2050 because of _______.A) economic growthB) the widening gap between the rich and poorC) wasteful use of energyD) the rapid advances of science and technology60. The author believes that, since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, ________.A) politicians have started to do something to better the situationB) few nations have adopted real tough measures to limit energy useC) reductions in energy consumption have greatly cut back global warmingD) international cooperation has contributed to solving environmental problems61. What is the message the author intends to convey?A) Global warming is more of a moral issue than a practical one.B) The ultimate solution to global warming lies in new technologyC) The  debate over global warming will lead to technological breakthroughs.D) People have to give up certain material comforts to stop global warming.Passage TwoSomeday a stranger will read your e-mail without your permission or scan the Websites you’ve visited. Or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchase or cell phone bills to find out your shopping preferences or calling habits.In fact, it’s likely some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permission? It might be a spouse, a girlfriend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen — the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked.Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, that it’s important to reveal yourself to friends, family and lovers in stages, at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain. The digital bread crumbs (碎屑) you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to reconstruct who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can reveal what you think. Like it or not, increasingly we live in a world where you simple cannot keep a secret.The key question is: Does that matter?When opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most say they are concerned about losing it. A survey found an overwhelming pessimism about privacy, with 60 percent of respondents saying they feel their privacy is “slipping away, and that bothers me.”But people say one thing and do another. Only a tiny fraction of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths (收费站) to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that can track automobile movements. And few turn down supermarket loyalty cards. Privacy economist Alessandro Acquisti has run a series of tests that reveal people will surrender personal information like Social Security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cents-off coupon (优惠券).But privacy does matter – at least sometimes. It’s like health: When you have it, you don’t notice it. Only when it’s gone do you wish you’d done more to protect it.62. What does the author mean by saying “the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked ”(Lines 3-4, Para.2)?A) People’s personal information is easily accessed without their knowledge.B) In the 21st century people try every means to look into others’ secrets.C) People tend to be more frank with each other in the information age.D) Criminals are easily caught on the spot with advanced technology.63. What would psychologists advise on the relationships between friends?A) Friends should open their hearts to each other.B) Friends should always be faithful to each other.C) There should be a distance even between friends.D) There should be fewer disputes between friends.64. Why does the author say “we live in a world where you simple cannot keep a secret” (Line 5, Para.3)?A) Modern society has finally evolved into an open society.B) People leave traces around when using modern technology.C) There are always people who are curious about others’ affairs.D) Many search engines profit by revealing people’s identities.65. What do most Americans do with regard to privacy protection?A) They change behaviors that might disclose their identity.B) They use various loyalty cards for business transactions.C) They rely more and more on electronic devices.D) They talk a lot but hardly do anything about it.66. According to the passage, privacy is like health in that ________.A) people will make every effort to keep itB) its importance is rarely understoodC) it is something that can easily be lostD) people don’t cherish it until they lose itPart V   Cloze  (15 minutes)Universities are institution that teach a wide variety of subjects at advanced levels.

For questions 8 -10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage. That’s enough, kidsIt was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.“I’d watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he’d shoved,” she says.” I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, ’No, we don’t push,” What happened next was unexpected.“The boy’s mother ran toward me from across the park,” Stella says,” I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for disciplining her child, All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted, hurting other children in the process?”Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people’s children has become a minefield.In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister’s house it’s encouraged. For her, it’s about kids being kids: “If you can’t do it at three, when can you do it?”Each of these philosophies is valid and, it has to be said, my son loves visiting his aunt’s house. But I find myself saying “no” a lot when her kids are over at mine. That’s OK between sisters but becomes dangerous territory when you’re talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.“Kids aren’t all raised the same,” agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University.” But there is still an idea that they’re the property of the parent. We see our children as an extension of ourselves, so if you’re saying that my child is behaving inappropriately, then that’s somehow a criticism of me.”In those circumstances, it’s difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two schools of thought.“I’d go to the child first,” says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. Usually a quiet reminder that ’we don’t do that here’ is enough. Kids nave finely tuned antennae (直觉) for how to behave in different settings.”He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel neglectful, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents if they’re there and ask them to deal with it,” she says.    Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers: “Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Preface your remarks with something like: ’I know you’ll think I’m silly but in my house I don’t want…’”When it comes to situations where you’re caring for another child, white is straightforward: “common sense must prevail. If things don’t go well, then have a chat.”There’re a couple of new grey areas. Physical punishment, once accepted from any adult, is no longer appropriate. “A new set of considerations has come to the fore as part of the debate about how we handle children.”For Andrew Fuller, the child-centric nature of our society has affected everyone:” The rules are different now from when today’s parents were growing up,” he says, “Adults are scared of saying: ’don’t swear’, or asking a child to stand up on a bus. They’re worried that there will be conflict if they point these things out – either from older children, or their parents.”He sees it as a loss of the sense of common public good and public courtesy (礼貌), and says that adults suffer form it as much as child.Meredith Fuller agrees: “A code of conduct is hard to create when you’re living in a world in which everyone is exhausted from overwork and lack of sleep, and a world in which nice people are perceived to finish last.”“It’s about what I’m doing and what I need,” Andrew Fuller says. ”the days when a kid came home from school and said, “I got into trouble”. And dad said, ‘you probably deserved it’. Are over. Now the parents are charging up to the school to have a go at teachers.”This jumping to our children’s defense is part of what fuels the “walking on eggshells” feeling that surrounds our dealings with other people’s children. You know that if you remonstrate(劝诫) with the child, you’re going to have to deal with the parent. It’s admirable to be protective of our kids, but is it good?“Children have to learn to negotiate the world on their own, within reasonable boundaries,” White says. “I suspect that it’s only certain sectors of the population doing the running to the school –better –educated parents are probably more likely to be too involved.”White believes our notions of a more child-centered, it’ a way of talking about treating our children like commodities(商品). We’re centered on them but in ways that reflect positively on us. We treat them as objects whose appearance and achievements are something we can be proud of, rather than serve the best interests of the children.”One way over-worked, under-resourced parents show commitment to their children is to leap to their defence. Back at the park, Bianchi’ intervention(干预) on her son’ behalf ended in an undignified exchange of insulting words with the other boy’ mother.As Bianchi approached the park bench where she’d been sitting, other mums came up to her and congratulated her on taking a stand. “Apparently the boy had a longstanding reputation for bad behaviour and his mum for even worse behaviour if he was challenged.”Andrew Fuller doesn’t believe that we should be afraid of dealing with other people’s kids. “look at kids that aren’t your own as a potential minefield,” he says. He recommends that we don’t stay silent over inappropriate behaviour, particularly with regular visitors.1. What did Stella Bianchi expect the young boy’s mother to do when she talked to him?A) make an apologyB) come over to interveneC) discipline her own boyD) take her own boy away2.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.If you are a male and you are reading this ,congratulations: you are a survivor .According to statistics .you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman ,and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in , you will die on average five years before a woman.There are many reasons for this-typically, men take more risks than woman and are more likely to drink and smoke but perhaps more importantly, men don’t go to the doctor.“Men aren’t seeing doctors as often as they should, ” says Dr. Gullotta, “This is particularly so for the over-40s,when diseases tend to strike.”Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45,it should be at least once a year.Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old ma who had delayed doing anything about his smoker’s cough for a year.“When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer” he says, “Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged this life”According to a recent survey, 95%of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.“A lot of men think they are invincible （不可战胜的）”Gullotta says “They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think” Geez, if it could happen to him.Then there is the ostrich approach,” some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know, ” says Dr. Ross Cartmill.“Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,” Cartmill says .He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups.Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says.” But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death.”57.Why does the author congratulate his male readers at the beginning of the passage?A. They are more likely to survive serious diseases today.B. Their average life span has been considerably extended.C. They have lived long enough to read this article.D. They are sure to enjoy a longer and happier live.58.What does the author state is the most important reason men die five years earlier on average than women?A. men drink and smoke much more than womenB. men don’t seek medical care as often as womenC. men aren’t as cautions as women in face of dangerD. men are more likely to suffer from fatal diseases59. Which of the following best completes the sentence “Geez, if it could happen to him…’(line2,para,8)?A. it could happen to me, tooB. I should avoid playing golfC. I should consider myself luckyD. it would be a big misfortune60what does Dr. Ross Cartmill mean by “the ostrich approach”(line q para.9)A. a casual attitude towards one’s health conditionsB. a new therapy for certain psychological problemsC. refusal to get medical treatment for fear of the pain involvedD. unwillingness to find out about one’s disease because of fear61. What does Cartmill say about regular check-ups for men?A.They may increase public expensesB.They will save money in the long runC.They may cause psychological strains on menD.They will enable men to live as long as womenPassage TwoQuestions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.High-quality customer service is preached(宣扬) by many ,but actually keeping customers happy is easier said than doneShoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store, but instead will alert their friends, relatives, co-workers, strangers-and anyone who will listen.Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers decide t frequent their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde group and Wharton school“Storytelling hurts retailers and entertains consumers,” said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde group.” the store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement.”On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four other, and will no longer visit the specific store for every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative reviews. The resulting “snowball effect” can be disastrous to retailers.According to the research, shoppers who purchased clothing encountered the most problems. ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers.The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered (塞满了的) shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople.During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved the parking problems by getting moonlighting（业余兼职的）local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance eliminated the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided confrontation between those eyeing the same parking space.Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions.Most importantly, salespeople should be diplomatic and polite with angry customers.“Retailers who’re responsive and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren’t so friendly.” said Professor Stephen Hoch. “Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help.”Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by filing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. Retailers are hard-pressed to improve when they have no idea what is wrong.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答62. Why are store managers often the last to hear complaints?A Most customers won’t bother to complain even if they have had unhappy experiences.B Customers would rather relate their unhappy experiences to people around them.C Few customers believe the service will be improved.D Customers have no easy access to store managers.63. What does Paula Courtney imply by saying “ … the shopper must also find a replacement” (Line 2, Para. 4)?A New customers are bound to replace old ones.B It is not likely the shopper can find the same products in other stores.C Most stores provide the sameD Not complaining to the manager causes the shopper some trouble too.64. Shop owners often hire moonlighting police as parking attendants so that shoppers_____A can stay longer browsing in the storeB won’t have trouble parking their carsC won’t have any worries about securityD can find their cars easily after shopping65. What contributes most to smoothing over issues with customers?A Manners of the salespeopleB Hiring of efficient employeesC Huge supply of goods for saleD Design of the store layout.66. To achieve better shopping experiences, customers are advised to _________.A exert pressure on stores to improve their serviceB settle their disputes with stores in a diplomatic wayC voice their dissatisfaction to store managers directlyD shop around and make comparisons between stores Part V 								Cloze         				（15 minutes）Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.　　Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don’t meet need eligibility(资格)have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school.　　For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running.　　But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. “They’re trying to buy students,” says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum.　　Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it.　　“As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,” says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report’s ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17.　　Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, “served us well,” Inzer says, but “to be discounting the price for families that don’t need financial aid doesn’t feel right any more.”　　Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level.　　Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state’s public institutions.　　But in recent years, a growing chorus(异口同声)of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be “a sign that people are starting to realize that there’s this destructive competition going on,” says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need.　　David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors.　　“No one can take one-sided action,” says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption(豁免)from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, “This is a merry-go-round that’s going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.”　　A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don’t qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs.　　That’s one reason Allegheny College doesn’t plan to drop merit aid entirely.　　“We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,” says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny’s vice president for enrollment.　　Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment(捐赠), meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program.　　“Yeah, we’re playing the merit game,” acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. “The fact of the matter is, it’s not just about the lowest-income people. It’s the average American middle-class family who’s being priced out of the market.”　　*A few words about merit-based aid:　　Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships.　　Academic merit scholarships are based on students’ grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process. 　　Athletic merit scholarships are meant for students that excel(突出)in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee(裁判). Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance.　　Artistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio(选辑)of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.　　1. With more and more low-income students pursuing higher education, a number of colleges are ________.　　A) offering students more merit-based aid B) revising their financial aid policies　　C) increasing the amount of financial aid D) changing their admission processes　　2. What did   in  do three years ago?　　A) It tried to implement a novel financial aid program.　　B) It added $ 2.5 million to its need-based aid program.　　C) It phased out its merit-based scholarships altogether.　　D) It cuts its merit-based aid to help the needy students.　　3. The chief purpose of rankings-conscious colleges in offering merit aid is to ______.　　A) improve teaching quality B) boost their enrollments　　C) attract good students D) increase their revenues　　4. Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at , believes ______.　　A) it doesn’t pay to spend $ 1 million a year to raise its ranking　　B) it gives students motivation to award academic achievements　　C) it’s illogical to use so much money on only 4% of its students　　D) it’s not right to give aid to those who can afford the tuition　　5. In recent years, merit-based aid has increased much faster than need-based aid due to ______.　　A) more government funding to colleges B) fierce competition among institutions　　C) the increasing number of top students D) schools’ improved financial situations　　6. What is the attitude of many private colleges toward merit aid, according to David Laird?　　A) They would like to see it reduced.　　B) They regard it as a necessary evil.　　C) They think it does more harm than good.　　D) They consider it unfair to middle-class families.　　7. Why doesn’t Allegheny College plan to drop merit aid entirely?　　A) Raising tuitions have made college unaffordable for middle-class families.　　B) With rising incomes, fewer students are applying for need-based aid.　　C) Many students from middle-income families have come to rely on it.　　D) Rising incomes have disqualified many students for need-based aid.　　8. Annual renewal of academic merit scholarships depends on whether the recipients remain ______.　　9. Applicants for athletic merit scholarships need a recommendation from a coach or a referee who ______ their exceptional athletic performance.　　10. Applicants for artistic merit scholarships must produce evidence to show their ______ in a particular artistic fieldPart Ⅲ Listening Comprehension (35 minutes)　　Section A　　Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.

Overall, it was a group of well-class families, with married parents both living in the home.　　When the children were 2, researchers videotaped them at home in free-play sessions with both parents, 48 all of their speech. The study will appear in the November issue of The Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology.　　The scientists measured the 49 number of utterance (话语) of the parents, the number of different words they used, the complexity of their sentences and other 50 of their speech. On average, fathers spoke less than mothers did, but they did not differ in the length of utterances or proportion of questions asked.　　Finally, the researchers 51 the children’s speech at age 3, using a standardized language test. The only predictors of high scores on the test were the mother’s level of education, the 52 of child care and the number of different words the father used. 　　The researchers are 53 why the father’s speech, and not the mother’s, had an effect.　　“It’s well 54 that the mother’s language does have an impact,” said Nadya Pancsofar, the lead author of the study. It could be that the high-functioning mothers in the study had 55 had a strong influence on their children’s speech development, Ms. Pancsofar said, “or it may be that mothers are  a way we didn’t measure in the study.”　　注意：此部分试题在答题卡1上。　　A) already B) analyzed C) aspects D) characters E) contributing F) describing　　G) established H) quality I) quoted J) recording K) recruited L) total　　M) unconscious N) unsure O) yet Section B　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.　　Passage One　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.　　Throughout this long, tense election, everyone has focused on the presidential candidates and how they’ll change America. Rightly so, but selfishly, I’m more fascinated by Michelle Obama and what she might be able to do, not just for this country, but for me as an African-American woman. As the potential First Lady, she would have the world’s attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see.　　Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The prevailing theory seems to be that we’re all hot-tempered single mothers who can’t keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can’t escape the stereotype of being eye-rolling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic (酗酒的) mothers.　　These images have helped define the way all women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simple to be herself.　　It won’t be easy. Because few mainstream publications have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all.　　Just as she will have her critics, she will also have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady. Many African-American blogs have written about what they’d like to see Michelle bring to the White House—mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family. Michelle will have to work to please everyone—an impossible task. But for many African-American women like me, just a little of her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that’s been around for far too long.　　57. Why does Michelle Obama hold a strong fascination for the author?　　A) She serves as a role model for African women.　　B) She possesses many admirable qualities becoming a First Lady.　　C) She will present to the world a new image of African-American women.　　D) She will pay closer attention to the interests of African-American women.　　58. What is the common stereotype of African-American women according to the author?　　A) They are victims of violence. B) They are of an inferior violence.　　C) They use quite a lot of body language. D) They live on charity and social welfare.　　59. What do many African-Americans write about in their blogs?　　A) Whether Michelle can live up to the high expectations of her fans.　　B) How Michelle should behave as a public figure.　　C) How proud they are to have a black woman in the White House.　　D) What Michelle should do as wife and mother in the White House.　　60. What does the author say about Michelle Obama as a First Lady?　　A) However many fans she has, she should remain modest,　　B) She shouldn’t disappoint the African-American community.　　C) However hard she tries, she can’t expect to please everybody.　　D) She will give priority to African-American women’s concerns.　　61. What do many African-American women hope Michelle Obama will do?　　A) Help change the prevailing view about black women.　　B) Help her husband in the task of changing .　　C) Outshine previous First Lady.　　D) Fully display her fine qualities.　　Passage Two　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.　　When next year’s crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they’ll be joined by a new face; Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost (教务长) of Yale, who’ll become Oxford’s vice-chancellor—a position equivalent to university president in America.　　Hamilton isn’t the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in , , , etc, have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it’s gone global. Yet the talent flow isn’t universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from .　　The chief reason is that American schools don’t tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university’s budget. “We didn’t do any global consideration,” says Patricia Hayes, the board’s chair. The board ultimately picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist (活动家) who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a distinctively American thing, since  schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.　　Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student number. The decline in government support has made funding-raising an increasing necessary ability among administrators and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.　　In the past few years, prominent schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when  appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen “a major strengthening of Yale’s financial position.”　　Of course, fund-raising isn’t the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind of promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices.　　62. What is the current trend in higher education discussed in the passage?　　A) Institutions worldwide are hiring administrators from the 　　B) A lot of political activists are being recruited as administrators.　　C) American universities are enrolling more international students.　　D) University presidents are paying more attention to funding-raising.　　63. What is the chief consideration of American universities when hiring top-level administrators?　　A) The political correctness. B) Their ability to raise funds.　　C) Their fame in academic circles. D) Their administrative experience.　　64. What do we learn about European universities from the passage?　　A) The tuitions they charge have been rising considerably.　　B) Their operation is under strict government supervision.　　C) They are strengthening their position by globalization.　　D) Most of their revenues come from the government.　　65.  appointed Alison Richard as its vice-chancellor chiefly because _____.　　A) she was known to be good at raising money　　B) she could help strengthen its ties with Yale　　C) she knew how to attract students overseas　　D) she had boosted Yale’s academic status　　66. In what way do top-level administrators from abroad contribute to university development?　　A) They can enhance the university’s image.　　B) They will bring with them more international faculty.　　C) They will view a lot of things from a new perspective.　　D) They can set up new academic disciplines.

Campus plays a crucial role in educating the young generation and the consciousness of “green campus” will definitely produce a profound effect on students’ various environmental protection activities after their graduation. What’s more, the young generation is under the burden of severe environmental pollution and there are many problems waiting for them to solve.　　To make “green campus” come true, firstly, it is necessary to work out effective principles for the development of sustainable and recyclable campus. Secondly, it calls for people’s awareness of the serious pollution around us and actual action to reduce the waste. Last but not least, it is necessary to strengthen the ties between campus and society, so as to ensure that “green campus” can work smoothly with the co-effort of the whole society.　　建设绿色校园　　近来，随着建设并保持“绿色地球”的观念成为社会关注的焦点，“绿色校园”也成为校园里流行的话题。这无疑会给我们的校园和社会带来长远的利益。　　“绿色校园”不仅仅指绿色的环境，还包括人们头脑中的环境意识。学校在培养年轻一代上起着关键作用，“绿色校园”的意识必定会对学生毕业后的环境保护意识产生长远影响。更为重要的是，年轻一代面临着严重的环境污染，有太多问题等待他们去解决。　　为使“绿色校园”成为现实，首先应该制定出可持续发展、可长远发展的有效政策。其次，还需要人们对环境污染的严肃性有正确认识并采取实际行动切实减少污染。最后但同样重要的是，有必要加强学校和社会的联系以便在全社会共同努力下使“绿色校园”顺利实施。　　范文点评　　范文以“绿色校园”开篇，保证了文章切题。第一段开门见山，强调当今环保理念下构建“绿色校园”的长远意义。第二段，着重讨论“绿色校园”的含义，指出“绿色校园”不仅指校园中的绿化，还指生活在校园中的人们的绿色和环保意识，把校园这个小环境和社会这个大环境结合起来，说理更加深刻。第三段是谈及具体的做法，分一、二、三点进行论述，无疑是使“绿色校园”的理念落在实处。结构完整，首尾呼应，用词准确。关系词的正确使用让句与句之间、段与段之间衔接紧凑，思想表达成熟有深度。　　【生动的用词】 maintain保持;concept概念;profound长远的;sustainable可持续的;recyclable可循环的。　　【丰富的短语】bring benefit to带来利益;play a crucial role in发挥关键作用;under the burden of在……重负下;come true实现;call for要求。　　【多变的句式】　　范文中长句、短句、简单句、复杂句交叉使用。不同句型之间的转换，能让阅卷老师更好地了解考生对句子结构的掌握运用，从而获得高分。　　避错指导　　本次作文在题材上，虽然仍然延续了我们所熟悉校园类话题，但与社会背景有很大关系。刚刚闭幕的哥本哈根世界气候大会使环保减排这个主题成为焦点，在全世界都提倡可持续发展、和谐发展这一背景下的“绿色校园”，同时也是一个社会热点话题，这是我们审题时所必须考虑的。另外开篇时，切忌拖泥带水，应直截了当，使阅卷老师对文章主题一目了然。　　除正确审题之外，考生还应注意语言的准确运用，不落俗套。不同句型之间转换时，考生应对句子结构全面掌握，避免句式错误造成扣分。　　最后，应尽量避免单词拼写错误。本次作文常见的卷面拼写错误如下表：　　正确拼写 词性及词义 错误的拼写　　focus n. 焦点 focuse　　effect n. 影响 effection /affect　　environment n. 环境 envirment/invironment　　burden n. 负担 burdon　　solve v. 解决 slove　　serious a. 严肃的 serous　　true a. 真的 ture　　society n. 社会 soceity　　theory n. 理论 thery　　总之，考生在构思和写作过程中要尽可能做到思路完整，恰如其分地选择词汇。毕竟，无错表达才是四级语言表达合格的核心。　　能力拓展　　【同义词转换】　　作文表达除了准确，还要做到句式多变，词汇灵活多样。　　1. realize → be aware of 意识到　　We’d better be aware of the seriousness of pollution around us. 我们最好意识到周围污染的严峻性。　　2. keep → preserve 保持　　It is necessary to educate the students to be conscious of the importance to preserve the environment. 有必要教育学生意识到保护环境的重要性。　　3. lead → conduct 引导　　This will help conduct the activities of the college students. 这有助于引导大学生的行为。　　【话题备考锦囊】　　6. The idea of “a green campus” is beyond a green environment. “绿色校园”绝不仅仅是一个绿色环境。　　7. The construction of “a green campus” will greatly stimulate students to take part in various environmental protection activities. 建设“绿色校园”将会极大激励学生参与环境保护。　　8.

field同义，题目中需要填的是动词show的宾语，即一个名词，而原句中对应的excel却是动词词性，需要变成名词形式，所以答案就是excel的名词形式excellence。　　全文精译　　大学重新审视奖学金的价值　　许多大学给予学生经济资助时，最重要的依据仍然是学生良好的评估等级和较高的试卷分数。　　但是在未来几年里，预计低收入家庭的学生数占大学生总数的比例越来越大。一些学校正在重新考虑奖学金是否是利用大学宝贵的资金最有效的途径。　　例如，华盛顿特区的乔治•华盛顿大学上周公布说将削减约三分之一的奖学金，减少奖学金得主数，而将节省下来的大约250万美元用于助学金。位于宾夕法尼亚州米德维尔的阿勒格尼学院三年前也做出了类似的决定。　　纽约克林顿市的哈密尔顿学院说它将逐步淘汰奖学金。该规定不会使现有的奖学金得主失去奖学金，助学金制度将从2008年秋天入学的学生开始实行。　　并不是所有的大学都提供奖学金;一般来说，淘汰率越高的学校，越不太可能提供奖学金。例如，哈佛大学和普林斯顿大学慷慨地提供了各种助学金，但是许多不符合助学条件的家庭为了上名牌大学不管付多少钱都愿意。　　对于规模较小的地方性学院来说，他们只是努力填满空缺，奖学金只是财政收入的重要来源，因为许多奖学金得主仍需支付比奖学金金额更高的学费，而正是这些学费维持大学的运转。　　但是对于有排名意识的学校，奖学金已经成为招收一流学生和改善他们的学术效益的一种主要工具。斯基德莫尔大学的经济学家桑迪•波美说，“他们试图购买学生”。　　研究表明奖学金存在一种倾向，即大部分奖学金得主不依靠奖学金仍能支付得起学费。　　“展望未来，更迫切需要的助学金投资”，汉密尔顿的入学和助学金办公室主任莫尼卡•英泽说。汉密尔顿大学已提供10年的奖学金。在这段时间里，在《美国新闻和世界报导》对最好的文学院的排名中，它从第25名上升到第17名。　　奖学金每年帮助了大约75名学生，或大约4%的学生，花费大约为一年1百万美元，“奖学金给我们带来了好处”，英泽说，但“奖学金这种变相优惠学费的做法对不需要经济援助的家庭来说，似乎不妥。”　　助学金目前仍是学生接受资助的主要方式，包括国家助学金、联邦助学金和机构助学金。但是，从总体上和大学层面上来看，主要由学校和州提供的奖学金增长速度很快。　　一项由美国宾州州立大学教授唐纳德•海勒主持的研究报告表明，在1995-96和2003-04年之间，仅就大学的奖学金而言，增加了212%，而助学金增加了47%。至少有15个州也提供奖学金，通常是为了在公立大学中招收优等生。　　但是近年来，越来越多的批评已经迫使大学开始减少这种做法。汉密尔顿和其他大学最近的决策可能是“一种迹象，表明人们开始意识到这种破坏性的竞争”，波美说。波美与他人合作，共同发表了一份《大学报告》，对于大学资助不是建立在需要的基础之上表示担忧。　　明尼苏达私立大学委员会主席大卫•莱尔德认为，很多私立学校想减少奖学金，但害怕这样做，会使优秀学生流失到他们的竞争对手那里去。　　“没有人可以采取单方面行动，”莱尔德说。他正在探索是否能获得联邦反托拉斯法的豁免，以使会员大学可以讨论如何共同降低奖学金。“这是一个跑得很快的旋转木马，没有大学相信他们能承受摆脱木马束缚的风险。”　　一个复杂因素就是，奖学金已经在不符合助学金条件的中产阶级家庭中变得很受欢迎，结果许多家庭都依靠它。并且，随着学费不断增加，奖助学金之间的界限也变得模糊了。　　这是阿勒格尼大学并不打算完全取消奖学金的理由之一。　　“我们仍然相信对成绩优异者进行奖励的效用，好学生很重视奖学金”， 阿勒格尼大学负责招生的副校长斯科特•弗利达霍夫说。　　位于亚特兰大的艾莫利大学以拥有47亿美元的捐赠而自豪。同时该校拟采取新政策。今年，该大学宣布将取消特困生贷款，同时对中产阶级家庭的贷款进行限额，但它将扩大其已有28年历史的奖学金项目。　　“是的，我们在玩奖学金游戏，”负责大学本科教育的副院长汤姆兰•卡斯特承认。但这也有它的优势，他说，“事实上，这不仅仅关系到低收入人群，它还关系到无缘问津助学金、普通的美国中产阶级家庭。”　　* 关于奖学金制度的几点补充　　奖学金是向在某一领域杰出的学生提供的资助，通常是指学术、体育和艺术奖学金。　　学术奖学金是以学生在高中阶段的分数，平均成绩和学术表现为基础。它们通常是专门为学生在高中毕业后直接进入大学而设置的。然而，还有为学习成绩格外突出的在校大学生准备的奖学金。这些奖学金通常帮助学生交纳学费，只要他们继续符合条件，每年都可以继续享受。某些情况下，学生在申请过程中可能需要学校或者一位教师推荐。　　运动奖学金是为在任何一种体育运动中突出的学生设置的奖学金，从足球到田径项目。本奖学金必须有人推荐，因为杰出的运动表现必须得到教练或裁判的认可。申请者需要寄送包含他们最佳表现的一盘磁带。　　艺术奖学金要求申请者在一定艺术领域有突出表现。一般包括创作领域，如艺术、设计、时装、音乐、舞蹈或写作。申请艺术奖学金，通常要求学生提供一个选辑，它可以包括艺术作品集、音乐表演录像或舞蹈的视频Part

C) 每周一，持续12周。　　D) Three hours a week, 45 hours in total. D) 一星期三小时，总共45小时。　　【听音指导】由选项即可知本题考查数字的细节题，且考查的数字为持续的时间，初步推测为某一课程所持续的时间。所以如在听力过程中涉及数字都要作笔记，且应注意数字的上下文场景。　　【正确项分析】对该问题的回答，信息较分散，最初提到了every Monday, from 7 to 9:45。接下来在let me see停顿之后出现答案12 weeks，from September 1 to Christmas eve. 整合以上信息，应选C。　　【干扰项分析】选项A错在Thursday evening，原文中明确给出应该是Monday evening。选项B中的New Year’s eve也是偷梁换柱，应为Christmas eve。选项D涉及小计算，每晚3小时，持续12周，应大约总共36小时才正确。　　22.

Trading in financial markets combines both.　　W: How do you relax in the evening?　　M: I very rarely do anything work-related so it’s easy to escape the markets. I generally go to the gym or go for a run, especially if I’ve had a bad day. I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away. To do something my brain would regard as creative.　　W: Do you think what you do for relaxation is an effective way to beat stress?　　M: I don’t think there is a specific rule about how to beat stress. I generally find out what I do is effective for me.　　W: Would you consider changing your job because of the high stress factor?　　M: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors. However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing, and if used the right way, it can actually be a positive thing.　　W: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?　　M: Having said all that, I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. I enjoy a mental challenge. Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second. How you deal with and manage those emotions dictates short, medium and long term trading performance and success.　　23: What is the man’s job?　　24: Why does the man prefer to cook a meal rather than have a take-away?　　25: What does the man say about an element of stress in his job?　　女士：那么，到底为什么你的工作以紧张出名呢?　　男士：当人们束手无策或感觉被控制时，就会有压力感。金融市场上的交易正是这两者的结合。　　女士：你晚上如何放松?　　男士：我很少做与工作有关的事情，所以很容易逃脱市场。我通常去健身房或是出去跑步。尤其是在我感觉某天很糟糕的时候，更是如此。我总是做饭，而不是叫外卖。做点儿有创意的事。　　女士：你认为你放松自己的方法对消除压力有效吗?　　男士：消除压力没有特定的法宝。总的来说，我发现我所做的一切对我来说都是有效的。　　女士：你是否因压力大而考虑换工作呢?　　男士：因为压力的因素我曾考虑过离开我的工作。但是，我认为压力是一件好事。如果运用得当，压力实际上是有益的。　　女士：你喜欢工作中的哪些压力?　　男士：说了这么多，我的确喜欢不确定因素。我喜欢挑战。交易会在瞬间产生一系列大范围的情绪波动。你如何处理及管理这些情绪支配着中短期及长期交易业绩和成功。　　23：男士的工作是什么?　　24：为什么男士喜欢做饭，而不是叫外卖?　　25：关于工作中的压力感，男士说了什么?　　【词汇点拨】reputation n. 名声，名气;combine v. 合并;financial a. 金融的;take-away 外带食品;positive a. 积极的，有益的;uncertainty n. 不确定性Section B　　Passage One　　篇章结构　　本次四级听力篇章从内容难度上来讲，比2009年6月的更难。此篇文章属于天文类，讲的是除地球以外的星球上形成生命的可能性。曾经科学家们认为其他星球上存在生命的可能性不大，但是现在科学家在渐渐地定位那些有可能会形成生命的地方。文章对此举了一个例子，就是木星的一个卫星，叫木卫二。　　词汇点拨　　fascinated a. 着迷的;surface n. 表面;bacteria n 细菌;automatically ad. 自动地;probe n.探头，探针;evolution n. 进化　　话题词汇　　beneath prep. 在……之下　　Jupiter n. 木星　　moon n. 卫星，月球　　nitrogen n. 氮　　planet n. 行星，星球　　volcanic activity 火山活动　　难句解析　　1.

A) It has a number of active volcanoes. A) 有很多活火山。　　B) It has an atmosphere like the earth’s. B) 有像地球上的大气层。　　C) It has a large ocean under its surface. C) 在它的表面有一个大海洋。　　D) It has deep caves several miles long. D) 有几英里长的深洞穴。　　【听音指导】通过选项即可确定本题为对于某一事物的细节描述题，所以首先要解决各选项中it所指的内容。由第一题选项可初步推测，本题很可能考查的是对一个星球的描述。　　【正确项分析】问题为科学家在木卫二星球上找到什么，那么应该是Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface，意为航空观测镜发现了星球表面下有个大的海洋。C选项与原文一模一样。　　28. A) Light is not an essential element to it. A) 光不是必备因素。　　B) Life can form in very hot temperatures. B) 生命在很热的温度下能够形成。　　C) Every form of life undergoes evolution. C) 每种生命的形成都需要进化。　　D) Oxygen is not needed for some life forms. D) 氧在生命形成过程中没有必要。　　【听音指导】根据惯例，最后一个问题答案出现在篇章结束前三十秒左右，选项均涉及生命形成因素，分别为light，hot temperatures，evolution和oxygen，根据这些信息，可轻易在短文结束前找到答案。　　【正确项分析】注意转折连词but前后，原文为Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. But now, places have been found on earth that are in total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the ocean. And bacteria, primitive forms of life, have been seen there。意为科学家一直以为光是很重要的，但是现在他们发现完全黑暗的地方—比如几英里深的洞里，也有生命，即细菌。可见，光不是必备因素，选项A正确。　　原文及译文　　Since early times, people have been fascinated with the idea of life existing somewhere else besides earth. Until recently, scientists believed that life on other planets was just a hopeful dream. But now they are beginning to locate places where life could form. In 1997, they saw evidence of planets near other stars like the sun. But scientists now think that life could be even nearer in our own solar system. One planet scientists are studying very closely is Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface. The probes have also made the scientists think that under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat. Water and heat from volcanic activity are two basic conditions needed for life to form. A third is certain basic chemicals such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Scientists believe there might be such chemicals lying at the bottom of Europa’s ocean. They may have already created life or may be about to. You may wonder if light is also needed for life to form. Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. But now, places have been found on earth that are in total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the ocean. And bacteria, primitive forms of life have been seen there. So the lack of light in Europa’s sub-surface ocean doesn’t automatically rule out life forming.　　26. What did scientists once believe according to the passage?　　27. What have scientists found about Europa, a moon of Jupiter?　　28. What have scientists come to know recently about the formation of life?　　从很早以前，人们一直迷恋着地球以外的地方也存在生命的想法。直到近来，科学家们认为在其他星球上存在生命只不过是个充满希望的梦。但是，现在他们开始查找可能有生命的地方。1997年，科学家们在恒星附近，例如太阳，发现了行星的踪迹。科学家们现在认为生命可能我们更近，就在太阳系内。科学家们正密切关注的地方是木卫二，木星的一个卫星。太空探测器提供了证据表明木卫二表层之下有一个海洋。探测器也让科学家们认为木卫二表层有散发出火山热的岩石核心。火山活动的水和热量是生命形成的两个基本条件。第三个是一些基本的化学物质，如碳、氧和氮。科学家们认为在木卫二海洋底部可能存在这样的化学成分。他们可能已经创造了生命或即将产生生命。你可能在想光也是生命形成的必要条件。直到最近，科学家们仍认为光是不可或缺的。但现在已经在地球上发现，海洋几英里之下的黑暗的洞穴内有细菌，即原始生命形式的存在。所以不能排除缺乏光的木卫二地下海洋有生命形成的可能性。　　26. 根据短文，科学家曾相信什么?　　27. 科学家们发现关于木卫二的什么信息?　　28. 最近，科学家就生命的形成了解到什么?　　Passage Two　　篇章结构　　本篇讲述医生发现用纸记录下的东西比口语交流的信息更加准确和稳定。问题源自一位医生在对一个孩子的家庭口述交待了出院后的注意事项之后，发现这些亲属们竟然记不清到底医生讲了些什么，于是医生决定在以后交待注意事项的时候要把这些内容全印成纸质的东西，因为纸质的东西比口语更可靠。　　词汇点拨　　suffer v. 遭受;confusing a. 令人迷惑的;episode n. 插曲;version n. 版本;challenge v. 挑战　　话题词汇　　context n. 上下文　　physician n. 内科医生　　recover v. 恢复　　stability n. 稳定性　　act out 表演出来　　emergency room 急诊室　　oral communication 口头交际　　tailored to 定制的　　难句解析　　1. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members.　　【解析】此句为倒装句，强调listening to her，主语为a half a dozen other family members。正常语序为：A half a dozen other family members were also listening to her.　　2. All of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions.　　【解析】本句两分句由连词but连接，had heard为过去完成时，表示在家人问玛雅医生之前就发生了此动作。I have given just a few hours before做定语修饰the simple instructions，省略连接词that。 试题详解　　29. A) Whether they should take the child home. A) 他们是否应该将孩子带回家。　　B) What Dr. Mayer’s instructions exactly were. B) 玛雅医生的医嘱到底是什么。　　C) Who should take care of the child at home. C) 谁在家照顾孩子。　　D) When the child would completely recover. D) 什么时候这个孩子能完全恢复。　　【听音指导】浏览四个选项，应注意到都为wh-开头的疑问词，且提到了医生和孩子，take care of 以及recover，可初步推测此题涉及的场景为医院，病人为孩子。　　【正确项分析】问题为孩子的家人因为什么而争论，原文为the family asked her to settle an argument they’d been having over exactly what advice she had given，意为亲属们就医生到底讲过什么建议争论不休，问医生如何解决。选项B中的instructions与原文的advice同义，选项B正确。　　30. A) She encourages them to ask questions when in doubt. A) 她鼓励他们拿不准时就提问题。　　B) She makes them write down all her instructions. B) 她让他们记下她的医嘱。　　C) She has them act out what they are to do at home. C) 她让他们把将在家里做的事情表演出来。　　D) She asks them to repeat what are supposed to do. D) 她让他们复述要做的事。　　【听音指导】由第一题的选项可很有把握地推测she指代的是Doctor Myer，而与医生相对的多半为病人。注意关键词ask question，write down，act out和repeat。　　【正确项分析】玛雅医生如何确定病人完全明白了自己的建议呢?原文为She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do，原文的 tell her与选项D中的关键词repeat一致，选项D为正确答案，　　31. A) It lacks the stability of the printed word. A) 它缺乏印刷体的稳定性。　　B) It contains many grammatical errors. B) 它包含许多语法错误。　　C) It is heavily dependent on the context. C) 它十分依赖上下文语境。　　D) It facilitates interpersonal communication. D) 它有助于人际交往。　　【听音指导】本题为短文最后一题，应在文章最后出现。需要注意关键字stability，errors，context和communication。　　【正确项分析】此题是典型的篇章问题考法。答案出现在结尾处，问题是作者对于人类口语交流 (human speech) 总结了什么。原文为human speech lacks the stability and permanence of the printed word，与选项A一致。　　原文及译文　　In her early days as an emergency room physician, Doctor Joanna Mayer treated a child who had suffered a second degree burn. After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge, Doctor Mayer talked to the parents about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. A few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they’d been having over exactly what advice she had given. “As I talked to them, I was amazed.” she said, “All of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions. The most basic details were unclear and confusing. I was surprised, because these were intelligent people.” This episode gave Doctor Mayer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later---- most people just don’t listen very well.　　Nowadays, she says she repeats her instructions, and even conducts a reality check with some patients. She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts tailored to the patients’ situation. Doc. Mayer’s listeners are not unusual. When new or difficult material is presented, almost all listeners are faced with a challenge because human speech lacks the stability and permanence of the printed word. Oral communication is fast-moving and impermanent.　　29. What did the child’s family members argue about in the hospital?　　30. What does Doc. Mayer do to insure her patients understand her instructions?　　31. What does the speaker say about human speech?　　乔安娜•玛雅是一名急诊室医生。早年，她曾医治了一名二度烧伤的孩子。这个孩子接受完治疗准备出院时，玛雅医生告诉孩子父母在家如何照顾孩子，在场的还有六位家庭其他成员。几小时后，当她来与孩子再见的时候，孩子一家请她解决争论，他们一直争论她的医嘱到底是什么。“因为我已经告诉过他们，所以我很惊讶。”她说，“他们所有的人都在短短几小时前听到了我给出的简单的医嘱，但是他们有三、四个不同的版本。最基本的细节都不清楚且很困惑。我很吃惊，因为这些是聪明人。”这一段插曲给了玛雅医生第一个线索，而这迟早每个医生都会懂得，即大多数人听的不准确。　　如今，玛雅说她反复重复医嘱，甚至对一些病人进行现场核查。她要他们告诉她他们应该做的事。她还根据病人的情况提供可带回家的打印文本。玛雅医生的听众都是正常人。当面对新资料或难度较大的资料时，几乎所有的听众都会面临挑战，因为人类口语缺乏书面文字的稳定性和永久性。口头交流速度快但持续时间短。　　29. 孩子的家庭成员在医院里争论的是什么?　　30. 为确保病人明白她的医嘱，玛雅医生做了什么?　　31. 说话者如何评述人类口语?　　Passage Three　　篇章结构　　此篇讲的是商务工作中对员工的激励机制。主要内容为公司对员工的激励机制并非是人们通常以为的工资或者工作环境，而是工作中的挑战。　　词汇点拨　　challenging a. 挑战性的;logical a. 合理的;manually ad. 手动地;identify v. 认同;tedious a. 单调的，沉闷的　　话题词汇　　arbitrarily ad. 专横地　　mechanical a. 机械的　　robotics n. 机器人学　　by definition 当然　　job security 职业安全感　　labor relations 劳资关系　　难句解析　　1. It’s logical to suppose that things like good labor relations, good working conditions, good wages and benefits and job security motivate workers, but one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate workers.　　【解析】此句结构是由转折连词but引导的两个分句。前面一个分句中，it做形式主语，后面的不定式to suppose是真正主语。That引导宾语从句，介词like以及其引导内容做things的后置定语。后面一个分句中，one expert 与Frederick Herzberg为同位语，that后引导宾语从句。　　2. However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them.　　【解析】本句主句为there be 句型，常见的短语with the development of作时间状语，意为“随着……的发展”。jobs和people为表语，三个并列形容词boring， repetitive 和 mechanical一起修饰jobs，who引导的定语从句修饰先行词unskilled people试题详解　　32. A) Job security. A) 职业安全感。　　B) Good labor relations. B) 愉快的劳资关系。　　C) Challenging work. C) 挑战性的工作。　　D) Attractive wages and benefits. D) 有吸引力的工资和利益。　　【听音指导】预览选项中的关键词job security，labor relation，work，和wages and benefits可知，此篇短文主旨与工作有关，可初步推测与人们对工作的满足感有关。　　【正确项分析】此题问的是主题，到底什么可以真正激励员工好好工作呢。原文Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and interesting job, recognition and responsibility，连接词in contrast附近出现了答案，意为起到激励作用的东西包括工作的挑战性和趣味性，以及工作中需承担的责任即最终获得的认可。所以选选项C，即挑战性的工作。　　【干扰项分析】原文首句虽谈及选项A、B、D各项内容，但是but转折后全盘否定but one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate workers。故可全部排除。　　33. A) Many tedious jobs continue to be done manually. A) 许多单调工作继续由手工做。　　B) More and more unskilled workers will lose jobs. B) 越来越多的非技术工人将失业。　　C) Computers will change the nature of many jobs. C) 电脑将改变很多工作性质。　　D) Boring jobs will gradually be made enjoyable. D) 无聊的工作将变得快乐。　　【听音指导】从选项内容可知，本题考查的是工作的性质，应注意关键提示词—tedious，unskilled and lose job，computer和boring and enjoyable。　　【正确项分析】此题问到作者对电脑信息时代总结了什么。从原文中However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them.，连接词however后出现了答案。意为，尽管电脑和机器人技术不断发展，还是存在无聊的、重复的、机械性的工作，需要人力完成，对应到正确答案A选项中的tedious以及manually。　　34. A) Offer them chances of promotion. A) 提供给他们晋升机会。　　B) Improve their working conditions. B) 改善他们的工作条件。　　C) Encourage them to compete with each other. C) 鼓励他们相互竞争。　　D) Give them responsibilities as part of a team. D) 给他们责任，让他们成为团队一部分。　　【听音指导】此题为一细节题。选项B与其他三项明显不同，可初步排除。听音时，注意选项中的promotion，compete和team。　　【正确项分析】原文中激励超市员工工作是个案，但是问题本身针对的是总结性的答案。即出现在for example前的总结句：Give them some responsibilities, not as individuals, but as a part of a team。but后强调的是team，正确答案为选项D。　　35. A) They will not bring real benefits to the staff. A) 他们将不能给员工带来真正利益。　　B) They concern a small number of people only. B) 他们与少数人相关。　　C) They are arbitrarily set by the administrators. C) 是管理人员随意制定的。　　D) They are beyond the control of ordinary workers. D) 他们超出了普通工人的控制。　　【听音指导】首先意识到最后一题的答案应在文章结束前几句找，由各选项可知，所描述的对象并不是积极的，而是有负面影响的。　　【正确项分析】为什么金钱诱惑刺激不了工作热情，答案出现在结尾前30秒处，即Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which automatically only concern a few people，意为团队精神更能激起工作热情，因为金钱利益最终只会与团队中的个别人相关。答案为选项B。　　原文及译文　　It’s logical to suppose that things like good labor relations, good working conditions, good wages and benefits and job security motivate workers, but one expert, Frederick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate workers. They are merely satisfiers. Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and interesting job, recognition and responsibility. However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there’re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them. So how do managers motivate people in such jobs? One solution is to give them some responsibilities, not as individuals, but as a team. For example, some supermarkets combine office staff, the people who fill the shelves, and the people who work at the checkout into a team, and let them decide what product lines to stock, how to display them and so on. Many people now talk about the importance of a company’s shared values or culture with which all the staff can identify, for example, being the best hotel chain, or making the best, the most user-friendly or the most reliable products in a particular field. Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which ultimately only concern a few people. Unfortunately, there’s only a limited number of such goals to go around and by definition, not all the competing companies in an industry can seriously play in to be the best.　　32: What can actually motivate workers according to Frederick Herzberg?　　33: What does the speaker say about jobs in the computer era?　　34: What do some supermarkets do to motivate employees?　　35: Why does the speaker say financial targets are less likely to motivate workers?　　认为良好的劳资关系、愉悦的工作环境、较高的工资和福利待遇、工作安全性好能够激励员工，这是完全符合逻辑的。然而，专家弗洛迪克•赫兹伯格认为这些条件并不能激励员工，只是让员工得到满足的物质条件而已。相反，激励因素包括挑战性和趣味性的工作、认可和责任等。然而，即使随着计算机技术和机器人技术的发展，仍有大量无聊的、重复的和机械的工作，并且还必须有大量做这些工作的非技术人员。所以管理人员如何激励从事这种工作的人呢? 一种解决办法就是让他们承担责任，不是作为个人，而是作为团队。例如，有些超市把办公室人员、填货人和收银员编成一组，让他们决定进什么货、产品如何陈列等。现在很多人在谈论员工认同的公司的价值观和公司文化的重要性，如怎样成为最好的旅馆连锁，或在某一特定领域做最好的，用户最亲善的或者最可靠的产品。这样的价值观比那些只与少数人有关的财务目标更有可能激励员工。不幸的是，只有个别公司才会有这样的目标，当然，并不是所有的竞争公司在业界都能做成最好的。　　32：根据弗洛迪克•赫兹伯格的观点，什么可以激励员工?　　33：说话者就计算机时代的工作发表了什么观点?　　34：一些超市为激励员工采取了什么措施?　　35：为什么说财务目标不太可能激发员工? Section C　　原文重现　　In the humanities, authors write to inform you in many ways. These methods can be (36) classified into three types of informational writing: factual, descriptive, and process. Factual writing provides (37) background information on an author, composer or artist or on a type of music, literature, or art. Examples of factual writing include notes on a book jacket or (38) album cover and longer pieces, such as an article describing a style of music which you might read in a music (39) appreciation course. This kind of writing provides a (40) context for your study of the humanities.　　As its name (41) implies, descriptive writing simply describes or provides an (42) image of, a piece of music, art or literature. For example, descriptive writing might list the colors an artist used in a painting or the (43) instruments a composer included in a musical composition, so as to make pictures of sounds in the readers’ mind by calling up specific details of the work. (44) Descriptive writing in humanity, particularly in literature is often mixed with critical writing.　　Process writing explains a series of actions that bring about a result. (45) It tells the reader how to do something, for example, explaining the technique used to show a film. This kind of writing is often found in art, where understanding how an art has created a certain effect is important. (46)Authors may actually use more than one type of techniques in the given piece of informational writing.　　篇章结构　　此次复合式听写的话题比较专业，介绍了三类写作题材，即事实性的，描述性的和解说性的。短文结构，先总后分。原文中充斥了许多长难词，致使考生预读时就一头雾水。尤其是全文的首句：In the humanities, authors write to inform you in many ways. 关键是要正确理解humanities(人文学科)一词。　　词汇点拨　　humanities n. 人文学科;context n. 环境，语境，上下文;technique n. 技巧　　话题词汇　　composer n. 作曲家　　book jacket 护封　　instrument n. 乐器　　background information 背景知识　　music appreciation 音乐鉴赏　　musical composition 乐曲　　试题详解　　36.【听音指导】根据空前后内容，可推测此空意为“归类成……”，轻易可以联想到常考词classified，构成be classified into结构。　　37.【听音指导】事实性写作方式会提供什么样的信息，在预读时，很容易将其推测为形容词，但background是常见词，而background information作为背景知识，在日常生活中常常用到。　　38.【听音指导】此空中的内容与book，long piece并列，可知此空填写的词为名词，且与book等为一类。album发音特殊，一般不会与其他词相混，应注意拼写。　　39.【听音指导】由题意很容易判断此部分应为音乐鉴赏课，此空的难点在于appreciation (“鉴赏”)这个词的拼写。appreciate作动词，意为鉴赏，此空需要其名词形式。　　40.【听音指导】为研究人文学科提供环境，其中context是高频词，几乎在每次考试中都能考到，此题不易失分。　　41.【听音指导】此句话应理解为“正如名字所显示的那样”，立刻可以联系到show等词，而原文中的imply在以往四级考试中也反复出现。　　42.【听音指导】描述性的写作能提供什么?立刻就想到形象、印象。image这个词很容易填出。　　43.【听音指导】作曲家所用的音乐器具，自然为musical instrument。然而此空需要注意的是它的复数形式。　　44.【听音指导】此段讲述的是descriptive writing，此句位于本段的最后一句，应为总结性话语。答案为Descriptive writing in the humanities, particularly in literature is often mixed with critical writing。particularly可替换为especially，be mixed with意为“与……混合”。也可写为Descriptive writing is mixed with critical writing，那么既保留了句子的大意，而且也能规避如particularly这样的长难词。采分点为descriptive writing和critical writing。　　45.【听音指导】此段讲述的是processing writing，按照惯例此句为对其的总结性解释。shoot a film，意为拍电影。采分点为how to do something和 technique。　　46.【听音指导】整篇文章为总分式，先总述了三种写作题材，然后分别讲述每种写作题材的适用范围。此空独立成句，很可能论述三部分适用范围的交集。采分点为more than one type of technique is used in writing。　　全文精译　　在人文学科中，作者可以通过多种写作方式告知读者信息。这些方法可分为三类信息写作题材：事实性的，描述性的和解说性的。事实性写作提供了一位作家、作曲家或艺术家或者是一种音乐、文学或艺术的背景信息。事实性写作包括封面上的说明和专辑封面，较长的作品如音乐鉴赏课中可能读到的描述一种音乐风格的文章。这种写作题材为人文学科研究提供了依据。　　正如它的名字所暗示的，描写性写作指简单的描述或为一段音乐、一种艺术和文学树立一种形象。例如，描写性写作可能介绍一位艺术家在画中用过的色彩，或一位乐器作曲家在音乐作品中所用的乐器。通过具体描述，在读者的脑海里留下声音的图画。人文学科中的描写性写作，特别在文学中，经常与评论式写作共同使用。　　解说性写作是解释会带来某种结果的一系列的行动。它告诉读者如何做某事，例如，拍电影的技术。这种写作往往用于艺术中，因为理解艺术家如何创造了一种特定效果是很重要的。在一篇指定的信息写作中，作者可以运用多种写作技巧。　　Part IV Reading Comprehension　　Section A　　篇章结构　　全文共分为七段。第一段介绍了本文的主题——双职工家庭中，父亲可能比母亲对于孩子语言的发展有更大的影响力。第二至六段介绍研究者们对九十二个家庭的孩子的活动以及父母与之交流的语言进行了跟踪、调查，最后，当孩子们三岁时，研究者们对孩子进行了标准化的语言测试，并对他们的言语进行了分析。研究者们发现父亲而非母亲的言语对孩子更有影响。最后一段，那达亚•潘克索发说可能因为在研究中能力强的母亲已经对孩子的言语发展产生了很大的影响，或者可能母亲起作用的方式在研究中没有测量。　　词汇热身　　【名词】aspects 方面;characters 性质，特征;quality 质量　　【动词】analyzed 分析;established确定的，证实的; quoted 引用;recruited 招聘，招募;contributing 贡献，捐献;describing 描述;recording 记录　　【形容词】total 总共的，总计的;unconscious 不知道的，无意识的;unsure不确定;　　【副词】yet 还，仍旧;already 已经　　难句解析　　4.

For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university’s budget.　　【解析】when引导时间状语从句，其后是主句，该主句中的familiar with the state government是形容词短语作定语，修饰leader;而句末a major source of the university’s budget 是同位语来说明the state government。　　【译文】例如，科罗拉多大学董事会在遴选新校长时，他们想聘用一个与州政府熟悉的领导人，因为州政府是学校的主要资金来源。　　2.

The current approach which focuses on younger people and on skills for employment is not adequate to meet the challenges of demographic change.　　【解析】该句的主语是The current approach，主语后跟了一个which引导的定语从句。“is not adequate”是谓语，其后为动词不定式作目的状语。　　【译文】现在的教育方法倾向于年轻人和技能性训练，难以应对人口结构变化的挑战。　　5.

it will be a long time before we meet them again. 实地考察要花约翰和迈克五个月的时间;他们过很久才会再见面。②句型B：it was some time before…：意思是“在……之前过了一段时间”。例：He was told that it would be at least three more months before he could recover and return to work. 他被告知至少过三个月才能康复，重返工作岗位。　　90. keep pace with the constantly increasing demands of consumers或keep up with the constantly growing needs of consumers　　【结构分析】本句的主语是Production，谓语是has to be increased，后面的to keep pace with the constantly increasing demands of consumers是目的状语。　　【要点解析】 ① 固定搭配“与……保持同步”，可以翻译为keep pace with 或keep up with。②“不断增长的”，可以翻译为increasing，growing或rising。③“需求”可翻译为demands或needs。④“消费者”翻译为consumer。　　【原句精译】只有大幅提高产量才能与消费者不断增长的需求保持同步。　　【能力拓展】①keep pace with和……并驾齐驱，跟上 例：We must work hard to keep pace with the development of modern technology. 我们必须努力学习才能跟上现代科技的发展。②keep up with赶得上，和……保持联系 例：Students must work hard to keep up with their school work. 学生必须努力学习才能跟上功课。　　91. the fewer chances you will have of catching a cold　　【结构分析】本句的前半部分是从句，后半部分是主句。主句的主语是You。谓语是will have。【要点解析】本题主要考查 the more，the less的用法。其用法与the more，the more一致，可翻译为“越……越……”。①固定搭配“可能做某事”，可翻译为be likely to do sth;②固定搭配“感冒”，可翻译为catch a cold。　　【原句精译】锻炼越多，你越不大可能感冒。【能力拓展】“越……越……”句型：这种句型表达为：the+比较级+句子，the+比较级+句子。若the more修饰名词，则名词要提前，直接置于the more后，如试题中句子：The more exercise you take, the fewer chances you will have of catching a cold注意：资料收集于网上，仅供参考。2009年6月英语四级考试真题与答案真题：Part I Writing (30 minutes)Directions:	For this part, you are allowed 30 minute to write a short essay on the topic of students selecting their lectures.

As a manager, Tiffany is responsible for interviewing applicants for some of the positions with her company .During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise. He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said “untrustworthy,” so she decided to offer the job to her second choice.  “It wasn’t until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person,” Tiffany confesses. What she hadn’t known at the time of the interview was that the candidate’s “different” behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding . He was an Asian-American raised in a household where respect for those in authority was shown by averting(避开) your eyes. “I was just thrown off by the lack of ye contact; not realizing it was cultural,” Tiffany says. “I missed out ,but will not miss that opportunity again.” Many of us have had similar encounters with behaviors we perceive as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our under-standing of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions .Hire Advantage At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult ,employers who can eliminate invalid biases(偏爱) from the process have a distinct advantage .My company, Mindsets LLC ,helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots . A real estate recruiter we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make . “During my Mindsets coaching session ,I was taught how to recruit a diversified workforce. I recruited people from different cultures and skill sets .The agents were able to utilize their full potential and experiences to build up the company .When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.”Blinded by GenderDale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops on supervising a diverse workforce . “Through one of the sessions ,I discovered my personal bias ,” he recalls . “I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person , and being open to differences .” In his case , the blindness was not about culture but rather gender .“I had a management position open in my department ;and the two finalists were a man and a woman . Had I not attended this workshop , I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel . My reasoning would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position , I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel .”Dale’s assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization’s ability to tap into the full potential of a diverse workforce .“I learned from the class that instead of imposing my gender biases into the situation , I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision .” Dale credits the workshop , “because it helped me make decisions based on fairness .”Year of the Know-It-AllDoug is another supervisor who attended one of my workshops .He recalls a major lesson learned from his own employee.“One of my most embarrassing moments was when I had a Chinese-American employee put in a request to take time off to celebrate Chinese New Year . In my ignorance , I assumed he had his dates wrong , as the first of January had just passed . When I advised him of this , I gave him a long talking-to about turning in requests early with the proper dates .“He patiently waited , then when I was done , he said he would like Chinese New Year did not begin January first , and that Chinese New Year ,which is tied to the lunar cycle ,is one of the most celebrated holidays on the Chinese calendar . Needless to say , I felt very embarrassed in assuming he had his dates mixed up . But I learned a great deal about assumptions , and that the timing of holidays varies considerably from culture to culture .“Attending the diversity workshop helped me realize how much I could learn by simply asking questions and creating dialogues with my employees , rather than making assumptions and trying to be a know-it-all ,” Doug admits . “The biggest thing I took away from the workshop is learning how to be more ‘inclusive’ to differences.”A better Bottom Line   An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations internally , it is profitable as well . These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales .”Most of my customers speak English as a second language . One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone . It wasn’t until my boss received Mindsets’ training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service . As result , our customer base has increased .”   Once we start to see people as individuals . and discard the stereotypes , we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone . Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities . It is about building better communities and organizations that enhance us as individuals and reinforce our shared humanity .When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers , family , friends , etc , we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are flawed(有缺陷的) or contrary to our fundamental values . We need to train our-selves to think differently , shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us ,creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone .What bothered Tiffany during an interview with her candidate?He just wouldn’t look her in the eye.He was slow in answering her questions.His answers to some of her questions were irrelevant.His answers to some of her questions were irrelevant .2.

B) He could have done more for his company.        C) He had not managed his workforce well.        D) He must get rid of his gender bias.     6. What did Dale think of Mindsets LLC’s workshop?        A) It was well-intentioned but poorly conducted.        B) It tapped into the executives’ full potential.        C) It helped him make fair decisions.        D) It met participants’ diverse needs.     7. How did Doug, a supervisor, respond to a Chinese-American employee’s request for leave?He told him to get the dates right.   C)He flatly turned it downHe demanded an explanation.      D)He readily approved it.     8. Doug felt         when he realized that his assumption was wrong.     9. After attending Mindsets’ workshops, the participants came to know the importance of          to their business.     10. When we view people as individuals and get rid of stereotypes , we can achieve diversity and benefit from the        between us.Part III                     Listening Comprehension        (35 Minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.

When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written . Around 120 years ago, Ebbinghaus began his study of memory. He(36)      .on studying how quickly the human mind can remember (37)      . One result of his research is known as the total time hypothesis(假设), which simply means the amount you learn (38)       on the time you spend trying to learn it . This can be taken as our first rule of learning.Although it is usually true that studying for four hours is better than studying for one, there is still the question of how we should use the four hours. For example, is it better to study for four hours (39)      or to study for one hour a day for four days in a (40)      ?. The answer, as you may have (41)      , is that it is better to spread out the study times. This (42)      , through which we can learn more (43)      .by dividing our practice time, is known as the distribution of practice effect. Thus, (44)                                                                                                                . But we’re not finished yet. We haven’t considered how we should study over very short periods of time. (45)                                                                                       .Should you look at the same word in rapid succession, or look at the word and then have some delay before you look at it again ?(46)                                                                                                        .Part IV Reading Comprehension (reading in depth) (25 minutes)Section ADirections:	In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.     Every year in the first week of my English class, some students inform me that writhing is too hard. They never write, unless assignments  47  it . They fine the writing process  48  and difficult.      How awful to be able to speak in a language but not to write in it-  49  English , with its rich vocabulary . Being able to speak but not write is like living in an  50  mansion(豪宅) and never leaving one small room . When I meet students who think they can’t write, I know as a teacher my  51  is to show them the rest of the rooms . My task is to build fluency while providing the opportunity inherent in any writing activity to  52  the moral and emotional development of my students . One great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.     Writing ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done  53  , just like exercise ; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise , writing skills improve quickly with writing practice. I often see a rise in student confidence and  54  after only a few weeks of journal writing .     Expressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole student. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and  55  lives . They build skills so that some day they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation, or the perfect love letter. Every day that they write in their journals puts them a step         56  to fluency , eloquence (雄辩), and command of language .Section BDirections:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.     The January fashion show, called FutureFashion , exemplified how far green design has come. Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines.      The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to fine . “Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren’t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you’re doing and shat your customers are used to,” he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents.      Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers & Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs(企业家) who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable . It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional(过渡型的) cotton at higher prices , thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material . “Mainstream is about to occur,” says Hahn.     Some analysts(分析师) are less sure . Among consumers, only 18%are even aware that ecofashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer, when asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied: “Not that I’m aware of.” Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she’s on the hunt for “cute stuff that isn’t too expensive.” By her own admission, green just isn’t yet on her mind. But –thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers –one day it will be. 57. What is said about FutureFashion?A) It inspired many leading designers to start going green.B) It showed that designers using organic fabrics would go far.C) It served as an example of how fashion shows should be organized.D) It convinced the public that fashionable clothes should be made durable.58. According to Scott Hahn, one big challenge to designers who will go organic is that         .    A) much more time is needed to finish a dress using sustainable materials .    B) they have to create new brands for clothes made of organic materials .    C) customers have difficulty telling organic from non-organic materials .    D) quality organic replacements for synthetics are not readily available .59. We learn from Paragraph 3 that designers who undertake green fashion        .    A) can attend various trade shows free .    B) are readily recognized by the fashion world     C) can buy organic cotton at favorable prices .    D) are gaining more and more support .60. What is Natalie Hormilla’s attitude toward ecofashion?    A) She doesn’t seem to care about it.   C) She is doubtful of its practical value.    B) She doesn’t think it is sustainable    D) She is very much opposed to the idea61. What does the author think of green fashion?    A) Green products will soon go mainstream.    B) It has a very promising future.    C) Consumers have the final say.    D) It will appeal more to young people.Passage TwoQuestions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand(缕) of hair , a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims . The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people’s hair. “You’re what you eat and drink, and that’s recorded in you hair,” said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the . While U.S diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as raid clouds move.Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable , but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (同位素) . The heaviest raid falls first .As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to  than to .Similar patterns exist throughout the  By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. Cerling’s team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a mop of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops.They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of raid systems.“It’s not good for pinpointing (精确定位),” Cerling said . “It’s good for eliminating many possibilities.”Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near .The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair.When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months.She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern  and western .“It’s still a substantial area,” Park said “But it narrows it way down for me.”62. What is the scientists’ new discovery?A) One’s hair growth has to do with the amount of water they drink.B) A person’s hair may reveal where they have lived.C) Hair analysis accurately identifies criminal suspects. D) The chemical composition of hair varies from person to person. 63. What does the author mean by “You’re what you eat and drink” (Line 1, Para.3)?A) Food and drink affect one’s personality development.B) Food and drink preferences vary with individuals.C) Food and drink leave traces in one’s body tissues. D) Food and drink are indispensable to one’s existence. 64. What is said about the rainfall in ’s West?A) There is much more rainfall in  than in .B) The water it delivers becomes lighter when it moves inland.C) Its chemical composition is less stable than in other areas. D) It gathers more light isotopes as it moves eastward.65. What did Cerling’s team produce in their research?A) A map showing the regional differences of tap water.B) A collection of hair samples from various barber shops. C) A method to measure the amount of water in human hair. D) A chart illustrating the movement of the rain system.66. What is the practical value of Cerling’s research?A) It helps analyze the quality of water in different regions. B) It helps the police determine where a crime is committed. C) It helps the police narrow down possibilities in detective work.D) It helps identify the drinking habits of the person under investigation.Part V Cloze (15 minutes)  Part VI Translation (5 minutes)Directions:	Complete the sentences by translating into English the Chinese given in brackets.

The hidden reason behind this is not hard to analyze as there’s a growing awareness for the authorities regarding the urgency of popularization of culture, knowledge and history with every average person in our society. Only with free access to this live ‘database’, can most people fully enjoy what museums could offer to them.However, free admission to museums might lead to some social problems as well. The most obvious problem is that it might give museums a very heavy economic burden which directly impedes the sustainable development of these organizations. As a result, our government has to work out other ways to collect funds from different channels, which might be difficult to operate or control. On the other hand, free admission attracts too many visitors, some of which might not be well-purposed and do some conscious or unconscious damage to the valuable treasures which used to be well-preserved in the museums. As a university student, I am in favor of the free-admission conduct. Yet it is proposed that some measures should be taken to solve the potential problems caused by it. For example, museums can make some regulations to guide the behavior of visitors or set some ‘closed’ days for museums for regular maintenance. Only in this way can free-admission to museums become a long-lasting phenomenon and have sustainable development.Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning)阅读答案　　1. A.

To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular leisure activity in  is going for a walk. And when joggers (慢跑者) jog, they don’t run the streets. Every one of them instinctively heads to the park or the river. It is my profound belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not.　　But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived (丧失). I spent my boyhood climbing trees on Streatham Common, . These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and odd new perceptions about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found.　　The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (多动症). Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%.　　A study in  indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A  study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, academic levels were raised across the entire school.　　Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy (等级) based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity.　　Most bullying (恃强凌弱) is found in schools where there is a tarmac (柏油碎石) playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of  in Streatham, with its harsh tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners fantasising about wildlife.　　But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls.　　One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places.　　The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing emphasis for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality.　　In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world.　　Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, “A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its restorative process helps reduce anger and impulsive behaviour.” Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution.　　We tend to look on nature conservation as some kind of favour that human beings are granting to the natural world. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is profoundly damaging.　　Human beings are a species of mammals (哺乳动物). For seven million years they lived on the planet as part of nature. Our ancestral selves miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a pint of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.　　We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without the wild world we are not more but less civilised. Without other living things around us we are less than human.　　Five ways to find harmony with the natural world　　Walk: Break the rhythm of permanently being under a roof. Get off a stop earlier, make a circuit of the park at lunchtime, walk the child to and from school, get a dog, feel yourself moving in moving air, look, listen, absorb.　　Sit: Take a moment, every now and then, to be still in an open space. In the garden, anywhere that’s not in the office, anywhere out of the house, away from the routine. Sit under a tree, look at water, feel refreshed, ever so slightly renewed.　　Drink: The best way to enjoy the natural world is by yourself; the second best way is in company. Take a drink outside with a good person, a good gathering: talk with the sun and the wind with birdsong for background.　　Learn: Expand your boundaries. Learn five species of bird, five butterflies, five trees, five bird songs. That way, you see and hear more: and your mind responds gratefully to the greater amount of wildness in your life.　　Travel: The places you always wanted to visit: by the seaside, in the country, in the hills. Take a weekend break, a day-trip, get out there and do it: for the scenery, for the way through the woods, for the birds, for the bees. Go somewhere special and bring specialness home. It lasts forever, after all.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。　　1.

You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.　　What determines the kind of person you are? What factors make you more or less bold, intelligent, or able to read a map? All of these are influenced by the interaction of your genes and the environment in which you were 47 . The study of how genes and environment interact to influence 48 activity is known as behavioral genetics. Behavioral genetics has made important 49 to the biological revolution, providing information about the extent to which biology influences mind, brain and behavior.　　Any research that suggests that 50 to perform certain behaviors are based in biology is controversial. Who wants to be told that there are limitations to what you can 51 based on something that is beyond your control, such as your genes? It is easy to accept that genes control physical characteristics such as sex, race and eye color. But can genes also determine whether people will get divorced, how 52 they are, or what career they are likely to choose? A concern of psychological scientists is the 53 to which all of these characteristics are influenced by nature and nurture(养育), by genetic makeup and the environment. Increasingly, science 54 that genes lay the groundwork for many human traits. From this perspective, people are born 55 like undeveloped photographs: The image is already captured, but the way it 56 appears can vary based on the development process. However, the basic picture is there from the beginning.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　[A] abilities [I] extent　　[B] achieve [J] indicates　　[C] appeal [K] proceeds　　[D] complaints [L] psychological　　[E] contributions [M] raised　　[F] displayed [N] smart　　[G] essentially [O] standard　　[H] eventually　　Section B　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.　　Passage One　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.　　It is pretty much a one-way street. While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction. Pay has always been the biggest deterrent, as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job. For some industrial scientists, however, the attractions of academia (学术界) outweigh any financial considerations.　　Helen Lee took a 70% cut in salary when she moved from a senior post in Abbott Laboratories to a medical department at the . Her main reason for returning to academia mid-career was to take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions. Some areas of inquiry have few prospects of a commercial return, and Lee’s is one of them.　　The impact of a salary cut is probably less severe for a scientist in the early stages of a career. Guy Grant, now a research associate at the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics at the University of Cambridge, spent two years working for a pharmaceutical (制药的) company before returning to university as a post-doctoral researcher. He took a 30% salary cut but felt it worthwhile for the greater intellectual opportunities.　　Higher up the ladder, where a pay cut is usually more significant, the demand for scientists with a wealth of experience in industry is forcing universities to make the transition (转换) to academia more attractive, according to Lee. Industrial scientists tend to receive training that academics do not, such as how to build a multidisciplinary team, manage budgets and negotiate contracts. They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate, says Lee, perhaps experience in manufacturing practice or product development. “Only a small number of undergraduates will continue in an academic career. So someone leaving university who already has the skills needed to work in an industrial lab has far more potential in the job market than someone who has spent all their time on a narrow research project.”　　注意： 此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　57. By “a one-way street” (Line 1, Para. 1), the author means ________.　　[A] university researchers know little about the commercial world　　[B] there is little exchange between industry and academia　　[C] few industrial scientists would quit to work in a university　　[D] few university professors are willing to do industrial research　　58. The word “deterrent” (Line 2, Para. 1) most probably refers to something that ________.　　[A] keeps someone from taking action [C] attracts people’s attention　　[B] helps to move the traffic [D] brings someone a financial burden　　59. What was Helen Lee’s major consideration when she changed her job in the middle of her career?　　[A] Flexible work hours. [C] Her preference for the lifestyle on campus.　　[B] Her research interests. [D] Prospects of academic accomplishments.　　60. Guy Grant chose to work as a researcher at  in order to ________.　　[A] do financially more rewarding work　　[B] raise his status in the academic world　　[C] enrich his experience in medical research　　[D] exploit better intellectual opportunities　　61. What contribution can industrial scientists make when they come to teach in a university?　　[A] Increase its graduates’ competitiveness in the job market.　　[B] Develop its students’ potential in research.　　[C] Help it to obtain financial support from industry.　　[D] Gear its research towards practical applications.　　Passage Two　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.　　Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life. Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity (长寿) boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship. The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Farr, who wrote that widows and widowers (鳏夫) were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers. Studies since then suggest that marriage could add as much as seven years to a man’s life and two to a woman’s. The effect holds for all causes of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.　　Even if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the  has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn’t smoke. There’s a flip side, however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of  describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.　　So how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio-economic factors, health-service provision, emotional support and other more physiological (生理的) mechanisms. For example, social contact can boost development of the brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression later in life. People in supportive relationships may handle stress better. Then there are the psychological benefits of a supportive partner.　　A life partner, children and good friends are all recommended if you aim to live to 100. The ultimate social network is still being mapped out, but Christakis says: “People are interconnected, so their health is interconnected.”　　注意： 此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　62. William Farr’s study and other studies show that _________.　　[A] social life provides an effective cure for illness　　[B] being sociable helps improve one’s quality of life　　[C] women benefit more than men from marriage　　[D] marriage contributes a great deal to longevity　　63. Linda Waite’s studies support the idea that _________.　　[A] older men should quit smoking to stay healthy　　[B] marriage can help make up for ill health　　[C] the married are happier than the unmarried　　[D] unmarried people are likely to suffer in later life　　64. It can be inferred from the context that the “flip side” (Line 4, Para. 2) refers to _________.　　[A] the disadvantages of being married　　[B] the emotional problems arising from marriage　　[C] the responsibility of taking care of one’s family　　[D] the consequence of a broken marriage　　65. What does the author say about social networks?　　[A] They have effects similar to those of a marriage.　　[B] They help develop people’s community spirit.　　[C] They provide timely support for those in need.　　[D] They help relieve people of their life’s burdens.　　66. What can be inferred from the last paragraph?　　[A] It’s important that we develop a social network when young.　　[B] To stay healthy, one should have a proper social network.　　[C] Getting a divorce means risking a reduced life span.　　[D] We should share our social networks with each other.　　Part Ⅴ Cloze (15 minutes)　　Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage. For each blank there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D] on the right side of the paper. You should choose the ONE that best fits into the passage.

Thanks to the “family plan”policy,today in China many families have one child.Loving and caring for children is an old Chinese tradition that has remained for thousands of years.But the children are spoilt so much that they have less independence.They rely on their parents in everything.That is bad for a child's growing.Therefore,parents should develop the children's independence instead of doing everything for them.
There are some ways to help children to be independent.First of all,you should believe your children can do the things well.Second,give them more chances to practise,when they don't know how to do it,just tell them the way.Third,don't be afraid to see them fail.In the beginning,they may do something bad.But don't worry,just let them try again.They can do the work as well as you if given more time.
To be independent is good for the children.A child who is independent will succeed easily in the future.快速阅读：

　　Caught in the Web
　　A few months ago, it wasn't unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She'd wake up early, turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs – leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up, along with the dishes and dirty laundry, but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem.
　　"I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart – kind of slipping into a depression," said Carla. "I knew that if I didn't get off the dating sites, I'd just keep going," detaching (使脱离) herself further from the outside world.
　　Toebe's conclusion: She felt like she was "addicted" to the Internet. She's not alone.
　　Concern about excessive Internet use isn't new. As far back as 1995, articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There's still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible.
　　But as reliance on the Web grows, there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention: Last month, a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web.
　　"There's no question that there're people who're seriously in trouble because they're overdoing their Internet involvement," said psychiatrist (精神科医生) Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction.
　　Jonathan Bishop, a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities, is more skeptical. "The Internet is an environment," he said. "You can't be addicted to the environment." Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities, which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online.
　　The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2,500 adults. Like the 2005 survey, this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that "their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use." About 9% attempted to conceal "nonessential Internet use," and nearly 4% reported feeling "preoccupied by the Internet when offline."
　　About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems, and almost 14% reported they "found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time."
　　"The Internet problem is still in its infancy," said Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford professor. No single online activity is to blame for excessive use, he said. "They're online in chat rooms, checking e-mail, or writing blogs. [The problem is] not limited to porn (色情) or gambling" websites.
　　Excessive Internet use should be defined not by the number of hours spent online but "in terms of losses," said Maressa Orzack, a Harvard University professor. "If it's a loss [where] you're not getting to work, and family relationships are breaking down as a result, then it's too much."
　　Since the early 1990s, several clinics have been established in the U. S. to treat heavy Internet users. They include the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery and the Center for Internet Behavior.
　　The website for Orzack's center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction:
　　● Having a sense of well-being (幸福) or excitement while at the computer.
　　● Longing for more and more time at the computer.
　　● Neglect of family and friends.
　　● Feeling empty, depressed or irritable when not at the computer.
　　● Lying to employers and family about activities.
　　● Inability to stop the activity.
　　● Problems with school or job.
　　Physical symptoms listed include dry eyes, backaches, skipping meals, poor personal hygiene (卫生) and sleep disturbances.
　　People who struggle with excessive Internet use maybe depressed or have other mood disorders, Orzack said. When she discusses Internet habits with her patients, they often report that being online offers a "sense of belonging, and escape, excitement [and] fun," she said. "Some people say relief…because they find themselves so relaxed."
　　Some parts of the Internet seem to draw people in more than others. Internet gamers spend countless hours competing in games against people from all over the world. One such game, called World of Warcraft, is cited on many sites by posters complaining of a "gaming addiction."
　　Andrew Heidrich, an education network administrator from Sacramento, plays World of Warcraft for about two to four hours every other night, but that's nothing compared with the 40 to 60 hours a week he spent playing online games when he was in college. He cut back only after a full-scale family intervention (干预), in which relatives told him he'd gained weight.
　　"There's this whole culture of competition that sucks people in" with online gaming, said Heidrich, now a father of two. "People do it at the expense of everything that was a constant in their lives." Heidrich now visits websites that discuss gaming addiction regularly "to remind myself to keep my love for online games in check."
　　Toebe also regularly visits a site where posters discuss Internet overuse. In August, when she first realized she had a problem, she posted a message on a Yahoo Internet addiction group with the subject line: "I have an Internet Addiction."
　　"I'm self-employed and need the Internet for my work, but I'm failing to accomplish my work,to take care of my home, to give attention to my children," she wrote in a message sent to the group."I have no money or insurance to get professional help; I can't even pay my mortgage (抵押贷款) and face losing everything."
　　Since then, Toebe said, she has kept her promise to herself to cut back on her Internet use. "I have a boyfriend now, and I'm not interested in online dating," she said by phone last week. "It's a lot better now."

　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　When we think of green buildings, we tend to think of new ones – the kind of high-tech, solar-paneled masterpieces that make the covers of architecture magazines. But the U.S. has more than 100 million existing homes, and it would be __47__ wasteful to tear them all down and __48__ them with greener versions. An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses. And it would take an average of 65 years for the __49__ carbon emissions from a new energy-efficient home to make up for the resources lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest __50__, the greenest home is the one that has already been built. But at the same time, nearly half of U. S. carbon emissions come from heating, cooling and __51__ our homes, offices and other buildings. "You can't deal with climate change without dealing with existing buildings," says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust.
　　With some __52__, the oldest homes tend to be the least energy-efficient. Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that __53__ over time and let in more outside air.
　　Fortunately, there are a __54__ number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from __55__ ones like Lincoln's Cottage to your own postwar home. And efficiency upgrades (升级) can save more than just the earth; they can help __56__ property owners from rising power costs.

　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　You never see him, but they're with you every time you fly. They record where you are going,how fast you're traveling and whether everything on your airplane is functioning normally. Their ability to withstand almost any disaster makes them seem like something out of a comic book.They're known as the black box.
　　When planes fall from the sky, as a Yemeni airliner did on its way to Comoros Islands in the India ocean June 30, 2009, the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong. So when a French submarine (潜水艇) detected the device's homing signal five days later, the discovery marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy in which 152 passengers were killed.
　　In 1958, Australian scientist David Warren developed a flight-memory recorder that would track basic information like altitude and direction. That was the first mode for a black box, which became a requirement on all U.S. commercial flights by 1960. Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned and moved to the rear of the plane – the area least subject to impact – from its original position in the landing wells (起落架舱). The same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility.
　　Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots' conversations,and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft's final moments. Placed in an insulated (隔绝的) case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000℉. When submerged, they're also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they're still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane's black boxes were never recovered.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
　　57. What does the author say about the black box?
　　A) It ensures the normal functioning of an airplane.
　　B) The idea for its design comes from a comic book.
　　C) Its ability to ward off disasters is incredible.
　　D) It is an indispensable device on an airplane.
　　58. What information could be found from the black box on the Yemeni airliner?
　　A) Data for analyzing the cause of the crash.
　　B) The total number of passengers on board.
　　C) The scene of the crash and extent of the damage.
　　D) Homing signals sent by the pilot before the crash.
　　59. Why was the black box redesigned in 1965?
　　A) New materials became available by that time.
　　B) Too much space was needed for its installation.
　　C) The early models often got damaged in the crash.
　　D) The early models didn't provide the needed data.
　　60. Why did the Federal Aviation Authority require the black boxes be painted orange or yellow?
　　A) To distinguish them from the colour of the plane.
　　B) To caution people to handle them with care.
　　C) To make them easily identifiable.
　　D) To conform to international standards.
　　61. What do we know about the black boxes from Air France Flight 447?
　　A) There is still a good chance of their being recovered.
　　B) There is an urgent need for them to be reconstructed.
　　C) They have stopped sending homing signals.
　　D) They were destroyed somewhere near Brazil.Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "I never do anything right" into positive ones like "I can succeed." But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?
　　Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.
　　The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.
　　In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, "I am lovable."
　　Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.
　　The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy (心理治疗) that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2 上作答。
　　62. What do we learn from the first paragraph about the self-help industry?
　　A) It is a highly profitable industry.
　　B) It is based on the concept of positive thinking.
　　C) It was established by Norman Vincent Peale.
　　D) It has yielded positive results.
　　63. What is the finding of the Canadian researchers?
　　A) Encouraging positive thinking many do more harm than good.
　　B) There can be no simple therapy for psychological problems.
　　C) Unhappy people cannot think positively.
　　D) The power of positive thinking is limited.
　　64. What does the author mean by "… you're just underlining his faults" (Line 4, Para. 3)?
　　A) You are not taking his mistakes seriously enough.
　　B) You are pointing out the errors he has committed.
　　C) You are emphasizing the fact that he is not intelligent.
　　D) You are trying to make him feel better about his faults.
　　65. What do we learn from the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic?
　　A) It is important for people to continually boost their self-esteem.
　　B) Self-affirmation can bring a positive change to one's mood.
　　C) Forcing a person to think positive thoughts may lower their self-esteem.
　　D) People with low self-esteem seldom write down their true feelings.
　　66. What do we learn from the last paragraph?
　　A) The effects of positive thinking vary from person to person.
　　B) Meditation may prove to be a good form of psychotherapy.
　　C) Different people tend to have different ways of thinking.
　　D) People can avoid making mistakes through meditation. Part V Cloze (15 minutes)

　　Due Attention Should Be Given To Spelling
　　Correct spelling is a basic skill in English study. However, nowadays many students do not pay much attention to it.
　　They have their own reasons for misspelling. First of all, they like an easy way of studying, which causes some omissions and changes in spelling. Second, the teachers might not be very strict in students’ spelling. In China, teachers seem to be more concerned with grammar and vocabulary but not spelling.
　　To change this situation, in my opinion, the teachers and the students should work together. On one and, the teachers should give more attention to students’ spelling, asking the students to be conscious of the importance of correct spelling from the very beginning of their English study. On the other hand, the students themselves are supposed to be aware that correct spelling is a must in English study.
　　To sum up, correct spelling is so important that both students and the teachers should spare no efforts to achieve correct spelling.

I've done it hundreds of times." You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) Why Integrity MattersWhat is Integrity?　　The key to integrity is consistency--not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and ethical standards even when making life's hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.　　What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a lapse of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus, integrity must be one of our most important goals.Risky Business　　We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision-making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did, and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.　　Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can't see the risks we're taking, we can't make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn't know the rules about plagiarism may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit, or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is "unintentional" does not excuse the misconduct. Ignorance is not a defense."But Everybody Does It"　　Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts, but manage to fool themselves about the risks they're taking by using excuses: "Everyone else does it," "I'm not hurting anyone," or "I really need this grade." Excuses can get very elaborate: "I know I'm looking at another's exam, even though I'm supposed to keep my eyes on my own paper, but that's not cheating because I'm just checking my answers, not copying." We must be honest about our actions, and avoid excuses. If we fool ourselves into believing we're not doing anything wrong, we can't see the real choice we're making--and that leads to bad decisions.　　To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public, and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. Would you feel proud or ashamed of your actions? If you'd rather hide your actions, that's a good indication that you're taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.Evaluating Risks　　To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits ("what's in it for me"), and simply haven't considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious, and may include a "0" on a test or assignment; an "F" in the class; suspension or dismissal from school; transcript notation; and a tarnished reputation. In fact, when you break a rule or law, you lose control over your life, and give others the power to impose punishment: you have no control over what that punishment might be. This is an extremely precarious and vulnerable position. There may be some matters of life and death, or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren't many things that fall in this category.Getting Away With It--Or Not　　Those who don't get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn't learn from the test, depriving him/herself of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence: the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self-esteem and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty, and afraid of getting caught. Worst of all, a cheater who doesn't get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems "easier." This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences. Students have been dismissed from school because they didn't get this simple message: Honesty is the ONLY policy that works.Cheating Hurts Others, Too　　Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions "don't count" and don't really hurt anyone. But individual choices have a profound cumulative effect. Cheating can spread like a disease, and a cheater can encourage others just by being seen from across the room. Recent statistics suggest 30% or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others' grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating "poisons" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. ("If I don't cheat, I can't compete with those who do.") Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of good teaching is seeing students learn, but ⑧.a cheater says, "I'm not interested in what you're trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others." The end result is a blatant and destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the University, and harm those who worked hard for their degree.Why Integrity Matters　　If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. ⑨.We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others every day. If not, we couldn't put money in the bank, buy food, clothing, or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist--the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, ⑩.Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation's economy and our individual well-being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.　　In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.1.

The findings of the study go against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.Tony Little, headmaster of , warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.　　The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.　　But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the .Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with specifically "boy-focused" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have more acute vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given "hands-on" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. "Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern genre in which violence and sexism are major themes," James wrote.　　Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be "masterful and in charge" in relationships. "In mixed schools, boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means," the study reported. 57. The author believes that a single-sex school would _____________________.   	A force boys to hide their emotions to be “real man”	B help to cultivate masculine aggressiveness in boys 	C encourage boys to express their emotions more freely 	D naturally reinforce in boys that traditional image of a man58. It is commonly believed that in a mixed schools boys ____________________.A perform relatively better 			B grow up more healthily 	C behave more responsibly 			D receive a better education 59. What does Tony Little say about the British education system?A It fails more boys than girls academically 	  B It focuses more on mixed school education 	C It fails to give boys the attention they need 	D It places more pressure on boys than on girls 60. According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is ______________.A teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys 	B boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted 	C boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in 	D teaching can be designed to promote boys’ team spirit  61. Which of the following is characteristic of boys according to Abigail James’ report? A They enjoy being in charge 		B They conform to stereotypes 	C They have sharper vision 			D They are violent and sexist Passage Two It's an annual argument. Do we or do we not go on holiday? My partner says no because the boiler could go, or the roof fall off, and we have no savings to save us. I say that you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday. The joy of a recession means no argument next year – we just won't go.Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday. A YouGov poll of 2,000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession – financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterized by intense verbal aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved, and made men, more than women, extremely angry.Kim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money is such a big deal because of what it symbolizes, which may be different things to men and women. "People can say the same things about money but have different conceptions of what it is for," he explains. "They will say it's to save, to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them" He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something. "The biggest problem is that couples assume each other knows what is going on with their finances, but they don't. There seems to be more of a taboo about talking about money than talking about death. But you both need to know what you are doing, who is paying what into the joint account and how much you keep separately. In a healthy relationship you don't have to agree about money, but you have to talk about it."62. What does the author say about vacationing? A People enjoy it all the more during a recession 	B Few people can afford it without working hard	C It makes all the hard work worthwhile  	D It is the chief cause of family disputes63. What does the author mean by saying “money is known… to bring a relationship to its knees” (Line1 Para. 2)？A Money is considered to be the root of all evils	B Some people sacrifice their dignity for money 	C Few people can resist the temptation of money 	D Disputes over money may ruin a relationship 64. The YouGov poll of 2000 people indicates that in a recession _________________.A conflicts between couples tend to rise 	B it is more expensive for couples to split up	C couples show more concern for each other  	D divorce and separation rates increase 65. What does Kim Stephenson believe?A Money is often a symbol of a person’s status 	B Money means a great deal to both men and women 	C Men and women spend money on different things  	D Men and women view money in different ways 66. The author suggests at the end of the passage that couples should ________________A put their money together instead of keeping it separately 	B make efforts to reach agreement on their family budgets	C discuss money matters to maintain a healthy relationship 	D avoid arguing about money matters to remain romantic Part V Cloze Employers fear they will be unable recruit students with the skills they need as the economic recovery kicks in, a new survey 67_______.Nearly half of organizations told researchers they were already struggling to find 68_______ with skills in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), 69_______ even more companies expect to experience 70_______ of employees with STEM skills in the next three years.The Confederation of British Industry 71_______ 694 businesses and organizations across the public and 72_______ sectors, which together employ 2.4 million people.Half are 73_______ they will not be able to fill graduate posts in the coming years, while a third said they would not be able to 74_______ enough employees with the right A-level skills."75_______ we move further into recovery and businesses plan 76_______ growth, the demand for people with high-quality skills and qualifications will 77_______," said Richard Lambert, director general, CBI. “Firms say it is already hard to find people with the right 78_______ or engineering skills.

The reason for their failure is their lack of a strong will。　　In our modern world, nothing is simple and straightforward. Something might appear deceptively easy at first, but as we proceed on, we will find that it is actually extremely difficult. Therefore, we must take whatever we do seriously and be mentally prepared to make our utmost exertions. When we encounter obstacles and setbacks, we must apply our strong willpower and persevere until we finally succeed。　　For us university students, in our academic studies or in our daily life on campus, we might not be faced with insurmountable challenges. But we need to get prepared, right now, to take things seriously, try to cultivate our strong will, and be ready to pursue our goals through persistence and indefatigable will. I believe it’s the only way we can achieve our success。　　Nothing Succeeds Without a Strong Will　　Success depends on many factors, both physical and spiritual. In my opinion, mental factors like a strong will are far more decisive in enabling us to achieve success. For example, despite our repeated efforts to quit smoking, our lack of a strong will would still cause us to end up in failure。　　In any of our undertakings, we should first set a goal. Some goals are highly challenging. Without a strong will, people would give up in the middle and they fail to achieve their goals. For those people who do succeed, they succeed simply because they have that mental stamina which enables them to challenge even the most insurmountable difficulties。　　We often say that ‘Impossible is Nothing’. To make the impossible possible, we must exercise our perseverance and strong willpower. Or, as an English proverb goes, ‘If there is a will, there is a way.’ Our world is becoming increasingly competitive and only by making strong-willed efforts can we maximize our full potential and gain competitive edges, and prevail over all obstacles that lie in our way to success。2011年6月大学英语四级真题试卷及答案Part I Writing (30 minutes)       Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the topic of Online Shopping.

    Why does British food have a reputation for being so bad? Because it is bad! Those are not the most encouraging words to hear just before eating lunch at one of 's smartest British restaurants, Alfie's by KEE, but head chef Neil Tomes has more to say.
    "The past 15 years or so have been a noticeable period of improvement for food in ," the English chef says, citing the trend in British cuisine for better ingredients, preparation and cooking methods, and more appealing presentation. Chef such as Delia Smith, Nigel Slater, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay made the public realise that cooking - and eating - didn't have to be a boring thing. And now, most of the British public is familiar even with the extremes of Heston Blumenthal's molecular gastronomy, a form of cooking that employs scientific methods to create the perfect dish.
    "It's no longer the case that the common man in  is embarrassed to show he knows about food," Tomes says.There was plenty of room for improvement. The problems with the nation's cuisine can be traced back to the Second World War. Before the war, much of Britain's food was imported and when German U-boats began attacking ships bringing food to the country, Britain went on rations(配给).
    "As rationing came to an end in the 1950s, technology picked up and was used to mass-produce food," Tomes says. "And by then people were just happy to have a decent quantity of food in their kitchens."
    They weren't looking for cured meats, organic produce or beautiful presentation; they were looking for whatever they could get their hands on, and this prioritisation of quantity over quality prevailed for decades, meaning a generation was brought up with food that couldn't compete with neighbouring France, Italy, Belgium or Spain.
    Before star chefs such as Oliver began making cooking fashionable, it was hard to find a restaurant in  that was open after 9pm. But in recent years the capital's culinary(烹饪的) scene has developed to the point that it is now confident of its ability to please the tastes of any international visitor.
    With the opening of Alfie's in April, and others such as The Pawn, two years ago, modern British food has made its way to . "With British food, I think that  restaurant are keeping up," says David Tamlyn, the Welsh executive chef at The Pawn in Wan Chai. " diners are extremely responsive to new ideas or presentations, which is good news for new dishes."
    Chefs agree that diners in  are embracing the modern British trend. Some restaurants are modifying the recipes(菜谱)of British dishes to breathe new life into the classics, while other are using better quality ingredients but remaining true to British traditional and tastes. Tamlyn is in the second camp. "We select our food very particulary. We use US beef, New Zealand lamb and for our custards(牛奶蛋糊) we use Bird's Custard Powder," Tamlyn says. "Some restaurants go for custard made fresh with eggs, sugar and cream, but British custard is different, and we stay true to that."
    Matthew Hill, senior manager at the two-year-old SoHo restaurant Yorkshire Pudding, also uses better ingredients as a means of improving dishes. "There are a lot of existing perceptions about British food and so we can't alter these too much. We're a traditional British restaurant so there are some staples(主菜) that will remain essentially unchanged."
    These traditional dishes include fish and chips, steak and kidney pie and large pieces of roasted meats. At Alfie's, the newest of the British restaurants in town and perhaps the most gentlemen's club-like in design, Neil Tomes explains his passion for provenance(原产地). " has started to become really proud of the food it's producing. It has excellent organic farms, beautifully crafted cheeses, high-quality meats."
    However, the British don't have a history of exporting their foodstuffs, which makes it difficult for restaurants in  to source authentic ingredients.
    "We can get a lot of our ingredients once a week from the ," Tamlyn explains. "But there is also pressure to buy local and save on food miles, which means we take our vegetables from the local markets, and there are a lot that work well with British staples."
    The , in Mid-Levels, offers the widest interpretation of "British cuisine", while still trying to maintain its soul. The gastro-pub has existed in various locations in  since 2002. Singaporean head chef Tommy Teh Kum Chai offers daily specials on a blackboard, rather than sticking to a menu. This enables him to reinterpret British cuisine depending on what is available in the local markets.
    "We use a lot of ingredients that people wouldn't perhaps associate as British, but are presented in a British way. Bell peppers stuffed with couscous, alongside ratatouille, is a very popular dish." Although the ingredients may not strike diners as being traditional, they can be found in dishes across .
    Even the traditional chefs are aware of the need to adapt to local tastes and customs, while maintaining the Brutishness of their cuisine.
    At Yorkshire Pudding, Hill says that his staff asks diners whether they would like to share their meals. Small dishes, shared meals and "mixing it up" is not something commonly done in Britain, but Yorkshire Pudding will bring full dished to the table and offer individual plates for each dinner. "That way, people still get the presentation of the dishes as they were designed, but can carve them up however they like," Hill says.
    This practice is also popular at The Pawn, although largely for rotisseries(烤肉馆), Tamlyn says. "Some tables will arrive on Sunday, order a whole chicken and a shoulder of lamb or a baby pig, and just stay for hours enjoying everything we bring out for them."
    Some British traditions are too sacred(神圣的) to mess with, however, Tomes says. "I'd never change a full English breakfast."

    While elderly people   47   to sleep for fewer hours than they did when they were younger, this has a(n)   48   effect on their brain's performance and they would benefit from getting more, according to research.
    Sean Drummond, a psychiatrist (心理医生) at the University of California, San Diego, said that older people are more likely to suffer from broken sleep, while younger people are better at sleeping   49   straight through the night.
    More sleep in old age, however, is   50   with better health, and most older people would feel better and more   51   if they slept for longer periods, he said.
    "The ability to sleep in one chunk (整块时间) overnight goes down as we age but the amount of sleep we need to   52   well does not change," Dr Drummond told the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Diego.
    "It's    myth that older people need less sleep. The more healthy an older adult is, the more they sleep like they did when they were   54   . Our data suggests that older adults would benefit from    55    to get as much sleep as they did in their 30s. That's   56   from person to person, but the amount of sleep we had at 35 is probably the same amount we need at 75."A) alert          B) associated     C) attracting      D) cling       E) continuing  F) definitely      G) different      H) efficiently      I) formally     J) function  K) mixed        L) negative       M) sufficient      N) tend       O) youngerSection B Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.

    Recent reports found that lodging with a student of a different race may decrease prejudice and compel students to engage in more ethnically diverse friendships.
    An  study also found that black students living with a white roommate saw higher academic success throughout their college careers. Researchers believe this may be caused by social pressure.
    In a New York Times article, Sam Roakye-the only black student on his freshman year floor-said that "if you're surrounded by whites, you have something to prove."
    Researchers also observed problems resulting from pairing interracial students in residences.
    According to two recent studies, randomly assigned roommates of different race are more likely to experience conflicts so strained that one roommate will move out.
    An  study found that interracial roommates were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together by the end of the semester.Grace Kao, a professor at Penn said she was not surprised by the findings. "This may be the first time that some of these students have interacted, and lived, with someone of a different race," she said.
    At Penn, students are not asked to indicate race when applying for housing.
    "One of the great things about freshman housing is that, with some exceptions, the process throws you together randomly," said Undergraduate Assembly chairman Alec Webley. "This is the definition of integration."
    "I've experienced roommate conflicts between interracial students that have both broken down stereotypes and reinforced stereotypes," said one Penn resident advisor (RA). The RA of two years added that while some conflicts "provided more multicultural acceptance and melding (融合)," there were also "jarring cultural confrontations."
    The RA said that these conflicts have also occurred among roommates of the same race.
    Kao said she cautions against forming any generalizations based on any one of the studies, noting that more background characteristics of the students need to be studies and explained.
57. What can we learn from some recent studies?
 A) Conflicts between studies of different races are unavoidable.
 B) Students of different races are prejudiced against each other.
 C) Interracial lodging does more harm than good.
 D) Interracial lodging may have diverse outcomes.
58. What does Sam Boakye's remark mean?
 A) White students tend to look down upon their black peers.
 B) Black students can compete with their white peers academically.
 C) Black students feel somewhat embarrassed among white peers during the freshman year.
 D) Being surrounded by white peers motivates a black student to work harder to succeed.
59. What does the Indians Univerisity study show?
 A) Interracial roommates are more likely to fall out.
 B) Few white students like sharing a room with a black peer.
 C) Roommates of different races just don't get along.
 D) Assigning students' lodging randomly is not a good policy.
60. What does Alec Webley consider to be the "definition of integration"?
 A) Students of different races are required to share room.
 B) Interracial lodging is arranged by the school for freshmen.
 C) Lodging is assigned to students of different races without exception.
 D) The school randomly assigns roommates without regard to race.
61. What does Grace Kao say about interracial lodging?
 A) It is unscientific to make generalizations about it without further study.
 B) Schools should be cautious when making decisions about student lodging.
 C) Students' racial background should be considered before lodging is assigned.
 D) Experienced resident advisors should be assigned to handle the problems. 
Passage TwoGlobal warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.
    The report, to be released Friday, analyzed data and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition (营养不良) and heat-related health problems.
    But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.
    Along with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.
    Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was " a methodological embarrassment" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable (易受伤害的) regions. Dr. Pielke said that "climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention." But the report, he said, "will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed (有瑕疵的)"
    However, Soren Anderasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in  in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.
    In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards, while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.
62. What is the finding of the Global Humanitarian Forum?
 A) Global temperatures affect the rate of economic development.
 B) Rates of death from illness have risen due to global warming.
 C) Malnutrition has caused serious health problems in poor countries.
 D) Economic trends have to do with population and natural disasters.
63. What do we learn about the Forum's report from the passage?
 A) It was challenged by some climate and risk experts.
 B) It aroused a lot of interest in the scientific circles.
 C) It was warmly received by environmentalists.  D) It caused a big stir in developing countries.
64. What does Dr. Pielke say about the Forum's report?
 A) Its statistics look embarrassing.   B) It is invalid in terms of methodology.
 C) It deserves our closest attention.   D) Its conclusion is purposely exaggerated.
65. What is Soren Andreasen's view of the report?
 A) Its conclusions are based on carefully collected data.
 B) It is vulnerable to criticism if the statistics are closely examined.
 C) It will give rise to heated discussions at the  conference.
 D) Its rough estimates are meant to draw the attention of world leaders.
66. What does Kofi Annan say should be the focus of the  conference?
 A) How rich and poor regions can share responsibility in curbing global warming.
 B) How human and economic losses from climate change can be reduced.
 C) How emissions of heat-trapping gases can be reduced on a global scale.
 D) How rich countries can better help poor regions reduce climate hazards. 
Part Ⅴ  Cloze (15 minutes) Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage. For each blank there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D) on the right side of the paper. You should choose the ONE that best fits into the passage. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centreWhen it comes to eating amart for your heart, stop thinking about short-term fixes and simplify your life with a straightforward approach that will serve you well for years to come.
    Smart eating goes beyond analyzing every bite of food you lift   67   your mouth. "In the past we used to believe that   68   amounts of individual nutrients (营养物) were the   69   to good health," says Linda Van Horn, chair of the American Heart Association's Nutrition Committee. "But now we have a   70   understanding of healthy eating and the kinds of food necessary to   71   not only heart disease but disease   72   general," she adds.
    Scientists now   73   on the broader picture of the balance of food eaten   74   several days or a week   75   than on the number of milligrams (毫克) of this or that   76   at each meal. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains, for example, provide nutrients and plant-based compounds   77   for good health. "The more we learn, the more   78   we are by the wealth of essential substances they   79   ," Van Horn continues, "and how they   80   with each other to keep us healthy."
    You'll automatically be   81   the right heart-healthy track if vegetables, fruits and whole grains make   82   three quarters of the food on your dinner plate.    the restaurant one quarter with lean meat or chicken, fish or eggs.
    The foods you choose to eat as well as those you choose to   84   clearly contribute to your well-being. Without a   85   , each of the small decisions you make in this realm can make a big   86   on your health in the years to come.

The key to integrity is consistency--not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and ethical standards even when making life's hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.　　What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a lapse of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus, integrity must be one of our most important goals.　　Risky Business　　We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision-making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did, and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.　　Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can't see the risks we're taking, we can't make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn't know the rules about plagiarism may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit, or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is "unintentional" does not excuse the misconduct. Ignorance is not a defense.　　"But Everybody Does It"　　Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts, but manage to fool themselves about the risks they’re taking by using excuses: "Everyone else does it," "I'm not hurting anyone," or "I really need this grade." Excuses can get very elaborate: "I know I'm looking at another's exam, even though I'm supposed to keep my eyes on my own paper, but that's not cheating because I'm just checking my answers, not copying." We must be honest about our actions, and avoid excuses. If we fool ourselves into believing we're not doing anything wrong, we can't see the real choice we're making--and that leads to bad decisions.　　To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public, and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. Would you feel proud or ashamed of your actions? If you'd rather hide your actions, that's a good indication that you're taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.　　Evaluating Risks　　To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits ("what's in it for me"), and simply haven't considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious, and may include a "0" on a test or assignment; an "F" in the class; Suspension or Dismissal from school; transcript notation; and a tarnished reputation. In fact, when you break a rule or law, you lose control over your life, and give others the power to impose punishment: you have no control over what that punishment might be. This is an extremely precarious and vulnerable position. There may be some matters of life and death, or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren't many things that fall in this category.　　Getting Away With It--Or Not　　Those who don't get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn't learn from the test, depriving him/herself of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence: the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self-esteem and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty, and afraid of getting caught. Worst of all, a cheater who doesn't get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems "easier." This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences. Students have been dismissed from school because they didn't get this simple message: Honesty is the ONLY policy that works.　　Cheating Hurts Others, Too　　Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions "don't count" and don't really hurt anyone. But individual choices have a profound cumulative effect. Cheating can spread like a disease, and a cheater can encourage others just by being seen from across the room. Recent statistics suggest 30% or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others' grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating "poisons" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. ("If I don't cheat, I can't compete with those who do.") Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of good teaching is seeing students learn, but a cheater says, "I'm not interested in what you're trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others." The end result is a blatant and destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the University, and harm those who worked hard for their degree.　　Why Integrity Matters　　If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others every day. If not, we couldn't put money in the bank, buy food, clothing, or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist--the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation's economy and our individual well-being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.　　In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.　　1.

At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.　　11.　　W: I just heard about a really beautiful park in the east end of the town. There are a lot of roses in bloom.　　M: Why don’t we walk over there and see for ourselves?　　Q: What will the speakers probably do?　　12.　　M: My presentation is scheduled for 9:30 tomorrow morning at the lecture hall. I hope to see you there.　　W: Oh, sorry. I was about to tell you that I have an appointment with my dentist at 9:00 o’clock tomorrow.　　Q: What do we learn about the woman?　　13.　　W: How long have you been running this company?　　M: Twenty years if you can believe that. I brought it from a small operation to what it is today.　　Q: What do we learn about the man?　　14.　　M: Have you read the news on the campus net? Susan has won the scholarship for next year.　　W: I knew she would from the very beginning. Such a brilliant and diligent girl! She certainly deserves it.　　Q: What does the woman mean?　　15.　　W: Taking a bus to , it’s cheaper than going by train.　　M: That’s true. But I’d rather pay a little more for the added comfort and convenience.　　Q: What does the man mean?　　16.　　M: I think it’s time we got rid of all this old furniture.　　W: You’re right. We need to promote our image besides it’s not a real antique.　　Q: What do the speakers mean?　　17.　　M: That was some storm yesterday. How was I afraid I couldn’t make it home.　　W: Yeah, most of the roads to my house were flooded. I didn’t get home from the lab until midnight.　　Q: What do we learn from the conversation?　　18.　　W: My boys are always complaining that they’re bored.　　M: Why don’t you get them into some team sports? My son and daughter play soccer every Saturday. And they both look forward to it all week.　　Q: What does the man mean?　　Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation you have just heard.　　W: I don’t know what to do. I can’t seem to get anyone in the hospital to listen to my complaints and this outdated equipment is dangerous. Just look at it.　　M: Hmm, uh, are you trying to say that it presents a health hazard?　　W: Yes, I am. The head technician in the lab tried to persuade the hospital administration to replace it, but they are trying to cut costs.　　M: You are pregnant, aren’t you?　　W: Yes, I am. I made an effort to get my supervisor to transfer me to another department, but he urged me not to complain too loudly. Because the administration is more likely to replace me than an X-ray equipment, I’m afraid to refuse to work. But I’m more afraid to expose my unborn child to the radiation.　　M: I see what you mean. Well, as your union representative, I have to warn you that it would take quite a while to force management to replace the old machines and attempt to get you transferred may or may not be successful.　　W: Oh, what am I supposed to do then?　　M: Workers have the legal right to refuse certain unsafe work assignments under two federal laws, the Occupation or Safety and Health Act and the National Labor Relations Act. But the requirements of either of the Acts may be difficult to meet.　　W: Do you think I have a good case?　　M: If you do lose your job, the union will fight to get it back for you along with back pay, your lost income. But you have to be prepared for a long wait, maybe after two years.　　Q19. What does the woman complain about?　　Q20. What has the woman asked her supervisor to do?　　Q21. What does the man say about the two federal laws?　　Q22. What will the union do if the woman loses her job　　Questions 22 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.　　W: Mr. Green, is it fair to say that negotiation is an art?　　M: Well, I think it’s both an art and science. You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically, but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one’s artistic quality. The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects.　　W: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects?　　M: Well, that’s I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor. You can pretend that you don’t like things which you are actually quite pleased about. Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who’s known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight. But the artistic part of negotiation I think has to do with responding immediately to cues one gets in the process of negotiation. These can be verbal cues or even body language. This is where the artistic quality comes in.　　W: So really, you see two types of negotiator then, the actor or the honest one.　　M: That’ right. And both can work. I would say the honest negotiator can be quite effective in some circumstances. In other circumstances you need an actor.　　Q23. When is a scientific approach best embodied in a negotiation according to the man?　　Q24. In what way is a negotiator like an actor according to the man?　　Q25. What does the man say about the two types of negotiator?　　Section B　　Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.　　Passage 1　　Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard.　　Since I started working part-time at a grocery store, I have learned that a customer is more than someone who buys something. To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely once he or she starts to push a shopping cart. One of the first things customers forget is how to count. There is no other way to explain how so many people get in their express line, which is clearly marked 15 items or less, with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items. Customers also forget why they came to the store in the first place. Just as I finish ringing up an order, a customer will say, “Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread. I hope you don’t mind waiting while I go get it.” Five minutes later, he is back with the bread, a bottle of milk, and three rolls of paper towels. Strange as it seems, customers also seem to forget that they have to pay for their groceries. Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card while I am ringing up the groceries, my customers will wait until I announce the total. Then, in surprise, she says, “Oh no, what did I do with my check book?” After 5 minutes of digging through her purse, she borrows my pen because she’s forgotten hers. But I have to be tolerant of customers because they pay my salary, and that’s something I can’t afford to forget.　　Q26. What does the speaker say about customers’ entering the grocery store?　　Q27. Which customers are supposed to be in the express line?　　Q28. What does the speaker say some customers do when they arrive at the check-out counter?　　Q29. What does the speaker say about his job at the end of the talk?　　Passage 2　　Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you have just heard.　　The speech delivery style of Europeans and Asians tends to be very formal. Speakers of these cultures often read oral presentations from carefully written manuscripts. On the other hand, American speakers are generally more informal relative to speakers in other cultures. American audiences prefer natural, spontaneous delivery that conveys a lively sense of communication. They don’t relate well to speakers who read from a manuscript. If you use an outline of your ideas instead of a prepared text, your speech will not only sound more natural, but you will also be able to establish better relationship with your listeners and keep their attention. The language and style you use when making an oral presentation should not be the same as the language and style you use when writing. Well-written information, that is meant to be read, does not work as well when it is heard. It is, therefore, important for you to adapt written texts or outlines for presentations. Good speakers are much more informal when speaking than when writing. They also use their own words and develop their own speaking styles. Whenever possible, they use short words. Listeners appreciate it when speakers use simple, everyday words in a presentation. One advantage is that it’s much easier for speakers to pronounce short words correctly. Another is that long and sophisticated vocabulary choices make listening more difficult.　　Question 30 to 32　　30. What does the speaker say American audiences prefer?　　31. What should one pay attention to when making an oral presentation?　　32. What does the speaker focus on in the talk?　　Passage 3　　Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.　　Let children learn to judge their own work. A child learning to talk does not learn by being corrected all the time. If corrected too much, he will stop talking. He compares a thousand times a day the difference between language as he uses it and language as those around him use it. Bit by bit, he makes the necessary changes to make his language like other people’s. In the same way, kids learning to do all the other things they learn without adult teachers, to walk, run, climb, ride a bike, play games, compare their own performance with what more skilled people do, and slowly make the needed changes. But in school we never give a child a chance to detect his mistakes. We do it all for him. We act as if we thought he would never notice a mistake unless it was pointed out to him. Soon he becomes dependent on the expert. We should let him do it himself. Let him figure out, with the help of other children if he wants it, what this word says, what is the answer to that problem, whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or that. If right answers need to be given, as in mathematics or science, give him the answer book. Let him correct his own papers. Why should we teachers waste time on such tedious work? Our job should be to help children when they tell us that they can’t find a way to get the right answer.　　Question 33 to 35　　33. How does a child learn to do something according to the speaker?　　34. What belief do teachers commonly hold according to the speaker?　　35. What does the speaker imply about the current way of teaching?　　Section C　　Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to43 with the exact words you have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.　　(听力原文)Time is, for the average American, of utmost importance. To the foreign visitor, Americans seem to be more concerned with getting things accomplished on time (according to a predetermined schedule) than they are with developing deep interpersonal relations. Schedules, for the American, are meant to be planned and then followed in the smallest detail. It may seem to you that most Americans are completely controlled by the little machines they wear on their wrists, cutting their discussions off abruptly to make it to their next appointment on time. Americans’ language is filled with references to time, giving a clear indication of how much it is valued. Time is something to be “on,” to be “kept,” “filled,” “saved,” “wasted,” “gained,” “planned,” “given,” “made the most of,” even “killed.” The international visitor soon learns that it is considered very rude to be late -- even by 10 minutes -- for an appointment in . Time is so valued in , because by considering time to be important one can clearly achieve more than if one “wastes” time and doesn’t keep busy. This philosophy has proven its worth. It has enabled Americans to be extremely productive, and productivity itself is highly valued in . Many American proverbs stress the value of guarding time, using it wisely, and setting and working toward specific goals. Americans believe in spending their time and energy today so that the fruits of their labor may be enjoyed at a later time.　　Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)　　Section A　　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.　　Questions 47 to 56 is based on the following passage.　　So many people use the cell phone so frequantly every day,But ___47__little is certain adout he health effects of its use.Macufacturers___48___that cell phones meet government standards for safe radio- frequency radiation omission,but enough studies are beginning to document a possible ___49___in rare brain tumour(肿 瘤)：bendaches and behavioral disorders in children to cause coneem.So far,the avidence isn't___50___on whether the use of cell phones __51__to any uncased risk of cancer.In a new　　trial,researchers asked 47 yolunteers to ___52__in a project to measure glucose(葡萄 糖)consurnption in the brain by scanning the brain to see how cells use energy.For both 50- minute scans,the volunteers had a cell phone __53__to each ear.During be first scan,the devices were turned off,but for the second scan,the phone on the right ear as___54____on and received a recorded- message call,although the yolume was muted(消毒)　　 so the dise wouldn't bias the results.The results of the second scan abowed that the__55__of the brain rarest to the device had higher rales of glucose consumption than the rest of the brain.The study ows that cell phones can change brain activity,and __56__a whole new avenue for scientific quiry,tuough it doesn't say anything about whether cell-phone radiation can cause cancer.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　A)conclusive 　　I)mission　　B)contributes 　 J)participate　　C)derive　　　　 K)particular　　D)expresses 　　L)provides　　E)fixed 　　　　　M)regions　　F)immensely 　　N)surprisingly　　G)increase 　　　O)switched　　H)maintain Section A　　这是一篇新闻报道类的文章，关于美国一些著名餐公司开始意识到快餐对对其青少年健康的不良影响，并开始采取相应措施改变这一现状。这是美国最近的热门话题， 经济学人新闻听写12月16日的的听写内容关于麦当劳的一篇文章与之就是类似的主题。 对于考生来说这一话题也并不陌生，从内容上来还是比较容易理解的。　　Section B　　As you are probably aware, the latest job markets news isn’t good: Unemployment is still more than 9 percent, and new job growth has fallen close to zero. That’s bad for the economy, of course. And it may be especially discouraging if you happen to be looking for a job or hoping to change careers right now. But it actually shouldn’t matter to you nearly as much as you think.　　That’s because job growth numbers don’t matter to job hunters as much as job turnover data. After all, existing jobs open up every day due to promotions, resignations, terminations, and retirements. (Yes, people are retiring even in this economy.) In both good times and bad, turnover creates more openings than economic growth does. Even in June of 2007, when the economy was still humming along, job growth was only 132,000, while turnover was 4.7 million!　　And as it turns out, even today — with job growth near zero — over 4 million job hunters are being hired every month.　　I don’t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn’t have an impact on one’s ability to land a job. It’s true that if total employment were higher, it would mean more jobs for all of us to choose from (and compete for). And it’s true that there are currently more people applying for each available job opening, regardless of whether it’s a new one or not.　　But what often distinguishes those who land jobs from those who don’t is their ability to stay motivated. They’re willing to do the hard work of identifying their valuable skills; be creative about where and how to look; learn how to present themselves to potential employers; and keep going, even after repeated rejections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that 2.7 million people who wanted and were available for work hadn’t looked within the last four weeks and were no longer even classified as unemployed.　　So don’t let the headlines fool you into giving up. Four million people get hired every month in the  You can be one of them.　　57. The author tends to believe that high unemployment rate ______?　　A) deprives many people of job opportunities.　　B) prevents many people from changing careers.　　C) should not stop people from looking for a job.　　D) does not mean the  economy is worsening.　　58. Where do most job openings come from?　　A) Job growth　　B) Job turnover　　C) Improved economy　　D) Business expansion　　59. What does the author say about overall job growth?　　A) It doesn’t have much effect on individual job seekers.　　B) It increases people’s confidence in the economy.　　C) It gives a ray of hope to the unemployed.　　D) It doesn’t mean greater job security for the employed.　　60.

So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors — or doesn’t it?　　While such vigilant(警觉的)tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it’s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing.　　In many cases, screening can lead to additional biopsies and surgeries to remove cancer, which can cause side effects, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not pose serious health problems in patients’ remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so ingrained that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a riotous reaction among doctors, patients and advocacy groups.  　　It’s hard to uproot deeply held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or prior personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the remainder, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy(预期寿命).　　A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening- especially considering the explosion of the elderly that will soon swell our population.　　It’s not an easy calculation to make, but one that make sense for the whole patient. Dr. Otis Brawley said, “Many doctors are ordering these tests purely to cover themselves. We need to think about the rational use of health care and stop talking about the rationing of health care.”　　That means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better.　　62. Why do doctors recommend routine cancer screening for elderly people?　　A. It is believed to contribute to long life.　　B. It is part of their health care package.　　C. The elderly are more sensitive about their health.　　D. The elderly are in greater danger of tumor growth.　　63. How do some researchers now look at routine cancer screening for the elderly?　　A. It adds too much to their medical bills.　　B. It helps increase their life expectancy.　　C. They are doubtful about necessity.　　D. They think it does more than good.　　64. What is the conventional view about women screening for breast cancer?　　A. It applies to women over 50.　　B. It is a must for adult women.　　C. It is optional for young women.　　D. It doesn’t apply to women over 74.　　65. Why do many doctors prescribe routine screening for cancer?　　A. They want to protect themselves against medical disputes.　　B. They want to take advantage of the medical care system.　　C. They want data for medical research.　　D. They want their patients to suffer less.　　66. What does the author say is the general view about health care?　　A. The more, the better.　　B. Prevention is better than cure.　　C. Better early than late.　　D. Better care, longer life.　　SB_2 答案　　62. D. The elderly are in greater danger of tumor growth.　　63. C. They are doubtful about its necessity.　　64. B. It is a must for adult women.　　65. A. They want to protect themselves against medical disputes.　　66. A. The more, the better.　　【点评】　　这是一篇有关癌症筛查的文章。长期以来，人们认为对于老年人来说，随着年龄的增长，肿瘤生长造成的威胁就越大，所以医生建议他们进行各类常规的癌症 筛查。但是近来，研究者开始怀疑它的必要性。当他们开始叫停50岁以下和74岁以上的妇女的乳腺癌筛查时，受惯例根深蒂固影响的人们掀起了轩然大波。不过，对于老年人来话说，癌症的风险还要和预期寿命进行权衡。近期的调查还显示很多医生让病人进行癌症筛查纯粹是为了在医疗事故中保护自己，所以这篇反对了 人们长期以来的对健康检查的误解，即健康检查并非多多益善。　　Part V Cloze　　Strong emotional bonds between mothers and infants increase children’s willingness to explore the world—an effect that has been observed 67 the animal kingdom, in people, monkeys and even spiders. The more secure we are in our 68 to Mom, the more likely we are to try new things and take risks. Now researchers are discovering that this effect continues into adulthood. A 69 reminder of Mom’s touch or the sound of her voice on the phone is　　70 to change people’s minds and moods, 71 their decision making in measurable ways.　　In a study 72 online in April in Psychological Science, undergraduate business students had to choose between safe bets and risky gambles—a bond with a guaranteed 4 percent yearly　　73 or a riskier stock option, for example. In half the cases, the experimenters patted the students 74 on the back of the shoulder for about one second 75 providing verbal instructions about the study. Both male and female students who were touched by a female experimenter were 76 more likely to choose the risky alternative 77 were those who had not been touched or were patted by male experimenters. The reassuring(宽慰的)touch of a woman may have induced early associations, 78 the same openness to exploration that is observed in young children of 79 mothers, explains Jonathan Levav, a business professor at Columbia University and lead author of the study.　　To further 80 that a woman’s touch links feelings of security 81 risk taking, the researchers asked a 82 group of undergraduates to make financial decisions after a writing exercise. Half of them wrote about a time they felt secure and supported, whereas the 83 half wrote about feeling insecure and alone. Evoking (唤起) a 84 of insecurity made students in the latter group 85 receptive to the gentle shoulder pats from female experimenters and much more willing to take a risk—just as a child leaving for a field trip might steal one last reassuring hug 86 Mom before stepping on the bus.　　67.

　　Small Schools Rising
　　This year's list of the top 100 high schools shows that today, those with fewer students are flourishing.
　　Fifty years ago, they were the latest thing in educational reform: big, modern, suburban high schools with students counted in the thousands. As baby boomers(二战后婴儿潮时期出生的人) came of high-school age, big schools promised economic efficiency. A greater choice of courses, and, of course, better football teams. Only years later did we understand the trade-offs this involved: the creation of excessive bureaucracies(官僚机构)，the difficulty of forging personal connections between teachers and students.SAT scores began dropping in 1963;today,on average,30% of students do not complete high school in four years, a figure that rises to 50% in poor urban neighborhoods. While the emphasis on teaching to higher, test-driven standards as set in No Child Left Behind resulted in significantly better performance in elementary(and some middle)schools, high schools for a variety of reasons seemed to have made little progress.
　　Size isn't everything, but it does matter, and the past decade has seen a noticeable countertrend toward smaller schools. This has been due ,in part ,to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested $1.8 billion in American high schools, helping to open about 1,000 small schools-most of them with about 400 kids each with an average enrollment of only 150 per grade, About 500 more are on the drawing board. Districts all over the country are taking notice, along with mayors in cities like ,  and . The movement includes independent public charter schools, such as No.1 BASIS in , with only 120 high-schoolers and 18 graduates this year. It embraces district-sanctioned magnet schools, such as the Talented and  , with 198 students, and the Science and Engineering Magnet,with383,which share a building in , as well as the    in , which grew out of volunteer  evening seminars for students. And it includes alternative schools with students selected by lottery(抽签)，such as H-B Woodlawn in Arlington, Va. And most noticeable of all, there is the phenomenon of large urban and suburban high schools that have split up into smaller units of a few hundred, generally housed in the same grounds that once boasted thousands of students all marching to the same band.
　　  in , , is one of those, ranking No.423-among the top 2% in the country-on Newsweek's annual ranking of 's top high schools. The success of small schools is apparent in the listings. Ten years ago, when the first Newsweek list based on college-level test participation was published, only three of the top 100 schools had graduating Classes smaller than 100 students. This year there are 22. Nearly 250 schools on the full ,Newsweek list of the top 5% of schools nationally had fewer than 200 graduates in 2007.
　　Although many of Hillsdale's students came from wealthy households, by the late 1990 average test scores were sliding and it had earned the unaffectionate nickname (绰号) "Hillsjail. " Jeff Gilbert. A Hillsdale teacher who became principal last year, remembers sitting with other teachers watching students file out of a graduation ceremony and asking one another in astonishment, "How did that student graduate?"
　　So in 2003 Hillsdale remade itself into three "houses," romantically named , Marrakech and . Each of the 300 arriving ninth graders are randomly(随机地) assigned to one of the houses. Where they will keep the same four core subject teachers for two years, before moving on to another for 11th and 12th grades. The closeness this system cultivates is reinforced by the institution of "advisory" classes Teachers meet with students in groups of 25, five mornings a week, for open-ended discussions of everything from homework problems to bad Saturday-night dates. The advisers also meet with students privately and stay in touch with parents, so they are deeply invested in the students' success."We're constantly talking about one another's advisers," says English teacher Chris Crockett. "If you hear that yours isn't doing well in math, or see them sitting outside the dean's office, it's like a personal failure." Along with the new structure came a more demanding academic program, the percentage of freshmen taking biology jumped from 17 to 95."It was rough for some. But by senior year, two-thirds have moved up to physics," says Gilbert "Our kids are coming to school in part because they know there are adults here who know them and care for them."But not all schools show advances after downsizing, and it remains to be seen whether smaller schools will be a cure-all solution.
　　The Newsweek list of top U.S. high schools was made this year, as in years past, according to a single metric, the proportion of students taking college-level exams. Over the years this system has come in for its share of criticism for its simplicity. But that is also its strength: it's easy for readers to understand, and to do the arithmetic for their own schools if they'd like.
　　Ranking schools is always controversial, and this year a group of 38 superintendents(地区教育主管)from five states wrote to ask that their schools be excluded from the calculation."It is impossible to know which high schools are 'the best' in the nation, "their letter read. in part. "Determining whether different schools do or don't offer a high quality of education requires a look at man different measures, including students' overall academic accomplishments and their subsequent performance in college. And taking into consideration the unique needs of their communities."
　　In the end, the superintendents agreed to provide the data we sought, which is, after all, public information. There is, in our view, no real dispute here, we are all seeking the same thing, which is schools that better serve our children and our nation by encouraging students to tackle tough subjects under the guidance of gifted teachers. And if we keep working toward that goal, someday, perhaps a list won't be necessary.注意：此部分试题请在答卡1上作答.

　　Answer Sheer 2  with a single line through the centre.Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　In times of economic crisis. Americans turn to their families for support. If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent. an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.
　　We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses, By 1932. when nearly one-quarter of the workforce was unemployed, the divorce rate had declined by around 25% from 1929 But this doesn't mean people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared neither spouse could manage alone.
　　Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households, Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes.
　　After financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities, A 1940 book. The Unemployed Man and His Family, described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job "with tireless search for work."He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do.
　　The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale(士气). For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold.
　　Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment.
　　Today's economic crisis could well generate a similar number of couples whose relationships have been irreparably(无法弥补地)ruined. So it's only when the economy is healthy again that we'll begin to see just how many broken families have been created.

　　Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage:
　　People are being lured (引诱)onto Facebook with the promise of a fun, free service without realizing they're paying for it by giving up toads of personal information. Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages.
　　Most Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Face book because people don't really know what their personal data is worth.
　　The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules Early on you keep everything private. That was the great thing about facebook you could create own little private network. Last year. The company changed its privacy rules so that many things you city. Your photo, your friends' names-were set, by default (默认)to be shared with every one on the Internet.
　　According to Facebook's vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don't share information They have a "less satisfying experience".

　　The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in . In April. Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites."I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them," Schrage admits.
　　I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it's only the beginning. Which is why I'm considering deactivating(撤销)my account. Facebook is a handy site, but I'm upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don't That's too high a price to pay.

　　Because conflict and disagreements are part of all close relationships, couples need to learn strategies for managing conflict in a healthy and constructive way. Some couples just   67   and deny the presence of any conflict in a relationship.   68   ,denying the existence of conflict results in couples    69   to solve their problems at early    70   ,which can then lead to even greater problems later   71   .Not surprisingly, expressing anger and disagreement leads to lower marital (婚姻的)satisfaction at the beginning. However, this pattern of behavior   72   increases in marital satisfaction over time. Research suggests that working   73   conflicts is an important predictor of marital satisfaction.
　　So, what can you do to manage conflict in your own relationships? First, try to understand the other person's point of view   74   put yourself in his of her place. People who are   75    to what their partner thinks and feels   76   greater relationship satisfaction. For example, researchers found that among people in dating relationships    77   marriages, those who can adopt their partner's perspective show more positive   78   .more relationship-enhancing attributes and more constructive responses   79    conflict.
　　Second, because conflict and disagreements are an   80    part of close relationships. People need to be able to apologize to their partner for wrongdoing and    81    forgiveness from their parents for their own acts. Apologies minimize conflict, lead to forgiveness, and serve to restore relationship closeness. In line    82    this view, spouses who are more forgiving show higher mental   83    over time. Increasingly, apologizing can even have    84    health benefits. For example, when people reflect on hurtful   85    and grudges(怨恨)，they show negative physiological(生理的) effects, including   86    heart rate and blood pressure, compared to when they reflect on sympathetic perspective-taking and forgiving.

The first reason is that a large number of companies believe that they can attract customers’ attention and stimulate their purchasing desire by over-packaging their goods, thus gaining more profits. On the other hand, quite a number of consumers mistakenly hold that the more delicate the package is, the better the quality will be, thus encouraging excessive packaging.In my point of view, excessive packaging has disastrous consequences, including the loss of precious resources, excessive consumption of water and energy, and unnecessary extraction of scarce land for landfill.To solve the problem, it’s necessary to take the following measures. First, laws and regulations must be made to restrict excessive packaging of companies. In addition, we need to raise consumer’s awareness that excessive packaging doesn’t equal to high quality and advocate packaging recycling. 1. D) providing good education for baby boomers.2. D) Students’ performance declined.3. D) They are mostly small in size.4. D) Some large schools have split up into smaller ones.5. C) their college-level test participation.6.

Are there enough campus police to do the job?　　There are 20 officers in the campus security division.

(39)Responding promptly to accidents and other (40)emergencies is important, but it is their smallest job.　　Dealing with crime takes up the rest of their time. Very (41)rarely did any violent crimes actually (42)occur.In the last five years there have been no (43)murders, seven robberies, and about sixty other violent attacks, most of these involving fights at parties.

Frankly, I’ve had enough of our canteen food。　　Q: What do we learn about the woman?　　13.　　W: Hey, if you can’t enjoy the music at a sensible volume, why not use earphones? I’m preparing for the speech contest。　　M: Oh, sorry. I didn’t realize I’ve being bothering you all this time。　　Q: What is the man probably doing?　　14.　　M: Finally, I’ve got the chance to put on my new suit tonight. I hope to make a good impression on your family。　　W: Come on! It’s only a family reunion. So jeans and T-shirts are just fine. 　　Q: What does the woman mean?　　15.　　M: Would you like to see those pants in brown and navy blue? These two colors are coming in this season。　　W: Oh, actually grey is my favorite color, but I prefer something made from cotton, 100% cotton I mean。　　Q: What is the woman looking for?　　16.　　W: From here, the mountains look as if you could just reach out and touch them。　　M: That’s why I chose this lodge. It has one of the best views in Switzerland。　　Q: What is the man’s chief consideration in choosing the lodge?　　17.　　M: What do I have to do to apply for a passport?　　W: You need proof of citizenship, either an old passport or a birth certificate and three photographs.

Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?　　M: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I’ll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn’t let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I’d love being my own boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want。　　W: You mean you don’t keep regular hours?　　M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business is slower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early。　　W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?　　M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It’s great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers。　　W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne.

Could you tell us something about that?　　W: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant, but steel-related manufacturing still accounts for 44% of industrial activity. So it’s still very important. In fact, 80% of Spain’s machine tools are from the Basque Country. As for paper processing, there’s still a little. But it’s no longer what it once was in the region. So, is that clear?　　M: Yes, thanks。　　W: Now, to get back to what I was saying, there’s a lot of unemployment as well as geographical problems in the region。　　M: Sorry, . What do you mean by geographical problems?　　W: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly, mountainous in parts. So there used to be transport problems, now though there are new train links and better roads, but it may be that some smaller towns inland remain not very well connected, is that OK? Does that make sense? When we talk about specific location suggestions for the factory, we’ll see this in more detail, so we’ll come back to this question, OK?　　M: OK, right。　　W: So I was about to say something about the work force in the region and the level of training and education. In general, it’s very good and improving。　　Question 23-25 are based on the conversation you have just heard。　　23. What does the woman say about the steel-related manufacturing in the region?　　24. What problem hinders the region’s development?　　25. What will the speakers discuss later?　　短文：　　Passage 1　　I first met Joe Ganz when we were both nine years old, which is probably the only reason he’s one of my best friends. If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school we wouldn’t even have had the chance to get to know each other. Joe is a day student, but I am a boarding student. We haven’t been in same classes, sports or extra-curricular activities. Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house and we talk on the phone every night. This is not to say that we would not have been compatible if we had first met in our freshman year. Rather, we would not have been likely to spend enough time getting to know each other due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests. In fact, to be honest, I struggle even now to think of things we have in common. But maybe that’s what makes us enjoy each other’s company so much. When I look at my friendship with Joe, I wonder how many people I’ve known whom I never disliked, but simply didn’t take the time to get to know. Thanks to Joe, I have realized how little basis there is for the social divisions that exist in every community. Since this realization, I have begun to make an even more determined effort to find friends in unexpected people and places。　　Q:　　26: Why does the speaker say Joe Ganz became one of his best friends?　　27: Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?　　28: What has the speaker learned from his friendship with Joe?　　Passage 2　　It was a bad night for Lewis. His research in the neighboring town has taken longer than he expected. It was late and he was very tired when he drove home. He turned into his building’s parking lot, but all the spaces were full. He drove back out onto the street, looking for a parking space. The first block was full. The next block was almost empty. Lewis didn’t see a “no parking” sign, but he has expected that his parking were allowed there. Most the spaces would be filled. Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces. He was so glad to see them that he didn’t even think to read the sign by the entrance. He drove in, parked and hurried home to go to bed. The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car. It was gone. He ran home and telephoned the city police to say that his car had been stolen. It took the police only a minute to tell him what had happened: his car had been on a private lot. It had been taken away by the police. Lewis had to take a taxi to visit the city garage far from the city center. He had to pay a fee of 40 dollars to get his car back. In addition, he got a parking ticket, his first one ever in Greenville。　　Q:　　29: Where did Lewis intend to park his car when he came back from work one night?　　30: What did Lewis think had happened to his car the next morning?　　31: Where did Lewis finally get his car back?　　Passage 3　　Well, to pick up where we left off last time, I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea. It was those things we all recognize when we see it, but we don’t really understand what it is. We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative, but we don’t know how they got that way. Is creativity a natural gift like good looks, or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge? Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully, we might get some insight into what it is and how it might work in our lives. The creative process has always been accepted as the source of all important work in the arts, but we should not think the creativity plays a role only in the arts. Every major scientific discovery began with someone imagining the world to look differently from the way others saw it. And this is what creativity is all about -- imagining the world in a new way. And despite what you may believe about the limits of your own creative imaginations, we all have the potential to imagine the world in an absolutely new way. In fact, you are born with it. It is your birth right as a human being. And what’s more, you use it every day, almost every moment of your life. Your creative imagination is what you use to make sense of your experiences. It’s your creative mind that gets meaning from chaos of experiences and brings order to your world。　　32. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?　　33. What is the widely accepted idea about the creative process?　　34. What leads to major scientific discoveries according to the speaker?　　35. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?　　复合式听写：　　Students have been complaining more and more about stolen property.

2013年12月英语四级完整版答案作文部分：范文一： The modern technology has greatly altered the mode of communication among people. With the help of the Internet, people can easily contact each other anytime anywhere. However, the side effect is that many people have become over-dependent on the Internet and neglected face-to-face communication.As far as I''m concerned, electronic communication cannot fully replace the direct contact among people. Although it seems to bring everyone together, it actually estranges people and decreases the effectiveness of communication. A typical example is that, traditionally, people working in the same office simply walk to others and talk. Today, however, co-workers tend to send e-mails or instant messages through the Internet even when they are sitting next to each other. As words can never convey the full message, it usually takes much more time and rounds of conversation than face-to-face communication, in which people can discuss more directly with less loss of information.To conclude, the Internet enables more effective communication in some situations, but over-dependence on it actually pulls people apart. 范文二： It is frequently observed that many people keep looking down at their mobile phones whatever they are doing. It is true that mobile phones have brought great convenience to us as we can send short messages, check e-mails, surf the Internet, or watch videos almost anywhere. However, the overuse of mobile phones also leads to some serious problems.The over-dependence on mobile phones can harm the relationship among friends and family. With mobile phones, people do not talk as much as before. For example, sometimes at dinner tables, instead of chatting and laughing with each other, many people choose to chat with other friends online. In other words, mobile phones help people contacting friends far away more easily at the expense of reducing the communication with those who are sitting right next to them.In conclusion, mobile phone can be a useful tool in modern life, but overusing it damages interpersonal relationship. There is no point to lose our intimacy with friends and family to modern technology. 范文三： The impact of the Internet on learningExplain why education doesn’t simply mean learning to obtain informationIn the age of knowledge explosion, the Internet opens a magical portal for leaners to get access to seemingly incessant information. But is information equal to knowledge? “Once I learn how to use google, isn''t that all the education I really need?” This question fully embodies the prejudiced opinion that as long as people acquire abundant information, they will get proper education.The reason why education doesn’t simply mean learning to obtain information is that education is not limited to the hard facts or theories students can learn from their textbooks or the Internet. It relates to a wider scope ranging from the obtainment of practical skills to the development of characters, which are hard for students to learn simply by googling. Consequently, comprehensive learning in schools that includes learning knowledge, conducting experiments and communicating with peers is what true education is.In a word, the Internet does provide valuable information for learners, but people should be fully conscious of the essence of education and learn to tell the right from the wrong.听力部分：1.

Can Digital Textbook Truly Replace the Print Kind?The shortcomings of traditional print edition textbooks are obvious: For starters they’re heavy, with the average physics textbook weighing 3.6 pounds. They’re also expensive, especially when you factor in the average college student’s limited budget, typically costing hundreds of dollars every semester. But the worst part is that print version of textbooks are constantly undergoing revisions. Many professors require that their students use only the latest versions in the classroom, essentially rendering older texts unusable. For students, it means they’re basically stuck with a four pound paper-weight that they can’t sell back. Which is why digital textbooks, if they live up to their promise, could help ease many of these shortcomings. But till now, they’ve been something like a mirage（幻影）in the distance, more like a hazy（模糊的）dream than an actual reality. Imagine the promise: Carrying all your textbooks in a 1.3 pound iPad? It sounds almost too good to be true. But there are a few pilot schools already making the transition（过渡）over to digital books. Universities like Cornell and Brown have jumped onboard. And one medical program at the  of , , gave their entire class iPads with which to download textbooks just last year. But not all were eager to jump aboard. “People were tired of using the iPad textbook besides using it for reading,” says Kalpit Shah, who will be going into his second year at ’s medical program this fall. “They weren’t using it as a source of communication because they couldn’t read or write in it. So a third of the people in my program were using the iPad in class to take notes, the other third were using laptops and the last third were using paper and pencil.” The reason it hasn’t caught on yet, he tells me, is that the functionality of e-edition textbooks is incredibly limited, and some students just aren’t motivated to learn new study behavior. But a new application called Inkling might change all that. The company just released an updated version last week, and it’ll be utilized in over 50 undergraduate and graduate classrooms this coming school year. “Digital textbooks are not going to catch on,” says Inkling CEO Matt Maclnnis as he’s giving me a demo（演示）over coffee. “What I mean by that is the current perspective of the digital textbook is it’s an exact copy of the print book. There’s Course Smart, etc., these guys who take any image of the page and put it on a screen. If that’s how we’re defining digital textbooks, there’s no hope of that becoming a mainstream product.” He calls Inkling a platform for publishers to build rich multimedia content from the ground up, with a heavy emphasis on real-world functionality. The traditional textbook merely serves as a skeleton. At first glance Inkling is an impressive experience. After swiping（敲击）into the iPad app (应用软件 ), which you can get for free here, he opens up a few different types of textbooks. Up first is a chemistry book. The boot time is pretty fast, and he navigates through (浏览 ) a few chapters before swiping into a fully rendered 3D molecule that can be spun around to view its various building blocks. “Publishers give us all of the source media, artwork, videos,” he says, “We help them think through how to actually build something for this platform.” Next he pulls up a music composition textbook, complete with playable demos. It’s a learning experience that attacks you from multiple sensory directions. It’s clear why this would be something a music major would love. But the most exciting part about Inkling, to me, is its notation（批注）system. Here’s how it works! When you purchase a used print book, it comes with its previous owner’s highlights and notes in the margins. It uses the experience of someone who already went through the class to help improve your reading (how much you trust each notation is obviously up to you). But with lnkling, you can highlight a piece of content and make notes. Here’s where things get interesting, though: If a particularly important passage is highlighted by multiple lnkling users, that information is stored on the cloud and is available for anyone reading the same textbook to come across. That means users have access to notes from not only their classmates and Facebook friends, but anyone who purchased the book across the country. The best comments are then sorted democratically by a voting system, meaning that your social learning experience is shared with the best and brightest thinkers. As a bonus, professors can even chime in (插话 ) on discussions. They’ll be able to answer the questions of students who are in their class directly via the interactive book. Of course, Inkling addresses several of the other shortcomings in traditional print as well. Textbook versions are constanly updated, motivating publishers by minimizing production costs (the big ones like McGraw-Hill are already onboard). Furthermore, students will be able to purchase sections of the text instead of buying the whole thing, with individual chapters costing as little as $2.99. There are, however, challenges. “It takes efforts to build each book,” Maclnnis tells me. And it’s clear why. Each interactive textbook is a media-heavy experience built from the ground up, and you can tell that it takes a respectable amount of manpower to put together each one. For now the app is also iPad-exclusive, and though a few of these educational institutions are giving the hardware away for free, for other students who don’t have such a luxury it’s an added layer of cost — and an expensive one at that. But this much is clear. The traditional textbook model is and has been broken for quite some time. Whether digitally interactive ones like Inkling actually take off or not remains to be seen, and we probably won’t have a definite answer for the next few years. However the solution to any problem begins with a step in a direction. And at least for now, that hazy mirage in the distance? A little more tangible (可触摸的 ), a little less of a dream. 1.

So here’s a suggestion offered by two researchers at the Rand Corporation: Why not take a lesson from alcohol control policies and apply them to where food is sold and how it’s displayed? “Many policy measures to control obesity（肥胖症）assume that people consciously and rationally choose what and how much they eat and therefore focus on providing information and more access to healthier foods,” note the two researchers. “In contrast,” the researchers continue, “many regulations that don’t assume people make rational choices have been successfully applied to control alcohol, a substance — like food — of which immoderate consumption leads to serious health problems.” The research references studies of people’s behavior with food and alcohol and results of alcohol restrictions, and then lists five regulations that the researchers think might be promising if applied to junk foods. Among them: Density restrictions: licenses to sell alcohol aren’t handed out unplanned to all comers but are allotted（分配）based on the number of places in an area that already sell alcohol. These make alcohol less easy to get and reduce the number of psychological cues to drink. Similarly, the researchers say, being presented with junk food stimulates our desire to eat it. So why not limit the density of food outlets, particularly ones that sell food rich in empty calories? And why not limit sale of food in places that aren’t primarily food stores? Display and sales restrictions:  has a rule prohibiting alcohol displays near the cash registers in gas stations, and in most places you can’t buy alcohol at drive-through facilities. At supermarkets, food companies pay to have their wares in places where they’re easily seen. One could remove junk food to the back of the store and ban them from the shelves at checkout lines. The other measures include restricting portion sizes, taxing and prohibiting special price deals for junk foods, and placing warning labels on the products. 57. What does the author say about junk food? A) People should be educated not to eat too much. B) It is widely consumed despite its ill reputation. C) Its temptation is too strong for people to resist. D) It causes more harm than is generally realized. 58. What do the  researchers think of many of the policy measures to control obesity? A) They should be implemented effectively. B) They provide misleading information. C) They are based on wrong assumptions. D) They help people make rational choices. 59. Why do policymakers of alcohol control place density restrictions? A) Few people are able to resist alcohol’s temptations. B) There are already too many stores selling alcohol. C) Drinking strong alcohol can cause social problems. D) Easy access leads to customers’ over-consumption. 60. What is the purpose of ’s rule about alcohol display in gas stations? A) To effectively limit the density of alcohol outlets. B) To help drivers to give up the habit of drinking. C) To prevent possible traffic jams in nearby areas. D) To get alcohol out of drivers’ immediate sight. 61. What is the general guideline the  researchers suggest about junk food control? A) Guiding people to make rational choices about food. B) Enhancing people’s awareness of their own health. C) Borrowing ideas from alcohol control measures. D) Resorting to economic, legal and psychological means. Passage Two Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage. Kodak’s decision to file for bankruptcy（破产）protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades, but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution. Although many attribute Kodak’s downfall to “complacency(自满) ,” that explanation doesn’t acknow-ledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak anticipated that digital photography would overtake film — and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 — but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business. It wasn’t that Kodak was blind to the future, said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at , but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late. Kodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets into the new businesses. Although Kodak anticipated the inevitable rise of digital photography, its corporate（企业的） culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability. Kodak’s downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak’s decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to , which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace. 62. What do we learn about Kodak? A) It went bankrupt all of a sudden. B) It is approaching its downfall. C) It initiated the digital revolution in the film industry. D) It is playing a dominant role in the film market. 63. Why does the author mention Kodak’s invention of the first digital camera? A) To show its early attempt to reinvent itself. B) To show its effort to overcome complacency. C) To show its quick adaptation to the digital revolution. D) To show its will to compete with ’s  photo. 64. Why do large companies have difficulty switching to new markets? A) They find it costly to give up their existing assets. B) They tend to be slow in confronting new challenges. C) They are unwilling to invest in new technology. D) They are deeply stuck in their glorious past. 65. What does the author say Kodak’s history has become? A) A burden.  B) A mirror.  C) A joke.  D) A challenge.  66. What was Kodak’s fatal mistake?  A) Its blind faith in traditional photography.  B) Its failure to see  photo’s emergence.  C) Its refusal to sponsor the 1984 Olympics.  D) Its overconfidence in its corporate culture.

子：Dad, I'm a bit worried about disposing of nuclear waste（处理核废料）
父：If you can empty the dustbin（垃圾筒） here, you can do anything

范文：
The picture shows us a dialogue between a father and a son. The son told his father, “Dad, I’m a bit worried about disposing of nuclear waste”. While his father told him, “If you can empty the dustbin here you can do anything”. It reveals the importance of doing small things well before undertaking something big. There is also an old Chinese saying to go with this that a person can’t sweep the world before he can sweep his own room.

Unquestionably, doing small things is the first step of success and will layroot for doing something big. By doing something small, we are enabled to accumulate experience, master skills and train ourselves to be more patient. In other word, we can be well prepared for further challenges in the course of fulfilling small things. By contrast, those who set out to do something big will be constantly haunted by disappointment, frustrations or even failures. As when opportunity “something big” appears, they can hardly seize them because of the lack of experience and confidence stems from doing small things.Taking the picture presented above as a case in point, how can the little boy succeed in disposing of nuclear weapons if he even doesn’t know how to empty the dustbin?

From my perspective, under no circumstances should we undervalue the power of doing small things. Instead, we should regard small things as the source of experience, skills and the prerequisite of success. “Great achievement only belongs to those who can do small things perfectly.” Aristotle once said.Part II     Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning)A. they are not rescued once a new edition comes out

Questions 33-35 are based on the passage you have just heard.Passage 3
Thank you for coming, everyone. Today’s presentation will show how we see the development of the motor car in the short to medium term, and that is why we have invited all of you here today. Let’s start with power. It’s clear that petrol-driven engines have no future. Already there are many alternative fuel vehicles on the market, powered by anything from solar power to natural gas. Some independent thinkers have even produced cars that run on vegetable oil. But as we all know, of all these alternative fuel vehicles, the most practical are electric vehicles. Sure, in the past electric vehicles have their problems, namely, a limited driving range, and very few recharging points, which limited their use. Now, however, recent developments in electric vehicle technology mean they can match conventional petrol engines in terms of performance and safety. Let’s not forget that electric vehicles are cleaner. Plus, importantly, the power source is rechargeable, so this does not involve using any valuable resources. Moving on to communications, very soon, cars will be linked to GPS satellites, so they’ll do all the driving for you. What controls remain for the users will be audio-based, so, for example, you’ll just have to say “a bit warmer”, and the air conditioning will adjust automatically. You’ll also be able to receive email, music and movies, all via an internet link. So just type in the destination you want, sit back, sleep, watch your movie, whatever.
Questions 33-35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33. What is the presentation mainly about?
34. What used to restrict the use of electric vehicles?
35. What does the speaker say about electric vehicles of today?

Section C
My favorite TV show? “The Twilight Zone.” I especially like the episode called “The Printer’s Devil.” It’s about a newspaper editor who’s being driven out of business by a big newspaper syndicate – you know, a group of papers owned by the same people. He is about to commit suicide when he is interrupted by an old man who says his name is Smith. The editor is not only offered 5,000 dollars to pay off his newspaper’s debts, but this Smith character also offers his services for free. It turns out that the guy operates the printing machine with amazing speed, and soon he is turning out newspapers with shocking headlines. The small paper is successful again. The editor is amazed at how quickly Smith gets his stories – only minutes after they happen – but soon he is presented with a contract to sign. Mr. Smith, it seems, is really the devil! The editor is frightened by this news, but he is more frightened by the idea of losing his newspaper, so he agrees to sign. But soon Smith is reporting the news even before it happens – and it’s all terrible – one disaster after another. Anyway, there is a little more to tell, but I don’t want to ruin the story for you. I really like these old episodes of the Twilight Zone, because the stories are fascinating. They are not realistic. But then again, in a way they are, because they deal with human nature.Part IV    Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)【答案】

48. 答案：J. maximum
【解析】：

49. 答案：D. component
【解析】：
根据上下文可以判断需要选择一个名词来与important搭配，根据句意判断strength training力量训练应该是physical activity体育活动的一个组成部分，所以要用component“部分、成分”。因此正确答案为D. component。
50.  maintain
【解析】：
根据上下文可以判断需要选择一个动词原型与build做并列成分，根据句意“力量训练的目的是为了增强和____骨骼和肌肉质量”，所以选择maintain“维持”符合文意。因此正确答案为I. maintain。
51. 答案：A. allowing
【解析】：

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
Junk food is everywhere. We’re eating way too much of it. Most of us know what we’re doing and yet we do it anyway.
So here's a suggestion offered by two researchers at the Rand Corporation: Why not take a lesson from alcohol control policies and apply them to where food is sold and how it’s displayed?
"Many policy measures to control obesity （肥胖症）assume that people consciously and rationally choose what and how much they eat and therefore focus on providing information and more access to healthier foods," note the two researchers.
"In contrast," the researchers continue, "many regulations that don't assume people make rational choices have been successfully applied to control alcohol, a substance -- like food -- of which immoderate consumption leads to serious health problems."
The research references studies of people’s behavior with food and alcohol and results of alcohol restrictions, and then lists five regulations that the researchers think might be promising if applied to junk foods. Among them:
Density restrictions: licenses to sell alcohol aren't handed out unplanned to all comers but are allotted （分配）based on the number of places in an area that already sell alcohol. These make alcohol less easy to get and reduce the number of psychological cues to drink.
Similarly, the researchers say, being presented with junk food stimulates our desire to eat it. So why not limit the density of food outlets, particularly ones that sell food rich in empty calories? And why not limit sale of food in places that aren’t primarily food stores?
Display and sales restrictions:  has a rule prohibiting alcohol displays near the cash registers in gas stations, and in most places you can’t buy alcohol at drive-through facilities. At supermarkets, food companies pay to have their wares in places where they're easily seen. One could remove junk food to the back of the store and ban them from the shelves at checkout lines. The other measures include restricting portion sizes, taxing and prohibiting special price deals for junk foods, and placing warning labels on the products.
注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
【总评】这是一篇讨论控制垃圾食品消费的议论文。文章介绍了Rand公司两位研究人员的建议：即借鉴控酒措施的经验，对售卖此类食品的地点和方式进行控制。文中具体介绍了这么做的原因以及一些具体条例。
57.What does the author say about junk food?
A) People should be educated not to eat too much.
B) It is widely consumed despite its ill reputation.
C) Its temptation is too strong for people to resist.
D) It causes more harm than is generally realized.
答案：C . Its temptation is too strong for people to resist.
【解析】推理题。由关键词Junk food定位至文章第一段。由“Junk food is everywhere. We're eating way too much of it. Most of us know what we're doing and yet we do it anyway.（垃圾食品无处不在，这样的食品我们吃得实在是太多了，我们大多数人都知道我们在做什么，但是我们还是在这么做）”可知，垃圾食品对人们的诱惑实在是太强了，以至于人们无法抵挡。选项B中的“ill reputation”在文中没有提到，所以，正确答案为C。
58.What do the  researchers think of many of the policy measures to control obesity?
A) They should be implemented effectively.
B) They provide misleading information.
C) They are based on wrong assumptions.
D) They help people make rational choices.
答案：C. They are based on wrong assumptions.
【解析】推理题。由关键词policy measures, obesity定位至文章第三段。文中提到“Many policy measures to control obesity (肥胖症）assume that people consciously and rationally choose what and how much they eat (很多控制肥胖症的政策都是假定人们能够有意识、理智地选择吃什么、吃多少)”，而第四段中进一步提到“In contrast… many regulations that don't assume people make rational choices have been successfully applied to control alcohol（那些没有假定人们会作出理智选择的规章条例在控酒方面取得了成功）”。由此可以推知，很多控制肥胖症的政策措施都是基于错误的假设前提的，所以，正确答案为C。
59.Why do policymakers of alcohol control place density restrictions?
A) Few people are able to resist alcohol’s temptations.
B) There are already too many stores selling alcohol.
C) Drinking strong alcohol can cause social problems.
D) Easy access leads to customers' over-consumption.
答案：D. Easy access leads to customers' over-consumption.
【解析】推理题。由关键词density restrictions，obesity定位至文章倒数第三段。由“These（即density restrictions） make alcohol less easy to get and reduce the number of psychological cues to drink.”可知，因为购买的途径很简单的话会导致消费者过度消费。所以要颁布这样一项限制措施，就是为了减少人们购买酒类饮品的数量。所以，正确答案为D。
60.What is the purpose of ’s rule about alcohol display in gas stations?
A) To effectively limit the density of alcohol outlets.
B) To help drivers to give up the habit of drinking.
C) To prevent possible traffic jams in nearby areas.
D) To get alcohol out of drivers’ immediate sight.
答案：D. To get alcohol out of drivers’ immediate sight.
【解析】推理题。由关键词California定位至文章最后一段。Display and sales restrictions:  has a rule prohibiting alcohol displays near the cash registers in gas stations, and in most places you can’t buy alcohol at drive-through facilities. At supermarkets, food companies pay to have their wares in places where they're easily seen. One could remove junk food to the back of the store and ban them from the shelves at checkout lines.关键词display，由此可知主要强调要把垃圾食品淡出人们的视线。所以，正确答案为D。
61.What is the general guideline the  researchers suggest about junk food control?
A) Guiding people to make rational choices about food.
B) Enhancing people’s awareness of their own health.
C) Borrowing ideas from alcohol control measures.
D. Resorting to economic, legal and psychological means
答案：C. Borrowing ideas from alcohol control measures.
【解析】细节题。由关键词Rand researchers定位到第二段。文中提到“So here's a suggestion offered by two researchers at the Rand Corporation: Why not take a lesson from alcohol control policies and apply them to where food is sold and how it's displayed? take a lesson即borrow ideas，由此可知，Rand公司的研究人员建议借鉴控酒措施的经验，所以，正确答案为C。Section B Passage 2
【总评】本文为我们分析了柯达公司虽然看到了市场前景，但是并没有在战略上把握机会，等意识到错误时，已经为时已晚，并最终走向衰败。对于一出生就接触各种数码产品的考生来说，柯达也许是个并不熟悉的企业，这或许会对阅读带来一定影响。而且本文也有不少商务用语，如strategy（战略，策略）、sponsorship（赞助），及一些关键词如anticipate（预期、预计）等，难度并不算小。所以平时对于词汇的积累是快速理解阅读内容的关键。
62. B. It's approaching its downfall.
【解析】细节题。从全文第一句中的bankruptcy (破产) 以及第二段第一句Although many attribute Kodak's downfall to "complacency"... 可知柯达已经衰落了。所以正确答案为B。
根据第全文第一句…a sad, though not unexpected turning point… 可知柯达的衰败，是早有预期的，而不是突然的，排除答案A. It went bankrupt all of a sudden；
根据第一段最后一句... but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution可知柯达最终没有适应数字革命，排除答案C. It initiated the digital revolution in the film industry；
根据第一段内容，dominate用的是过去分词形式，即柯达在胶卷市场占主导地位是过去的事实，而非现今，排除答案D. It is playing the dominant role in the film market.
63. A. To show its early attempt to reinvent itself.
【解析】推理题。柯达发明第一台数码相机的例子出现在第二段，该段一开始指出很多人将柯达的衰败归结于柯达的自满，但是这个解释并没有承认柯达在自我改造上做出的努力。接下来作者用柯达发明了第一台数码相机来例证柯达在reinvent上的尝试。所以正确答案为A。
答案C. To show its quick adaptation to the digital revolution.与第一段最后一句ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution. 相冲突，且发明了第一台数码相机并不足以说明其顺应了数码革命。
64. D. They are deeply stuck in their glorious past.
【解析】细节题。根据题干关键词large companies和switch定位到第四段最后一句Large companies have a difficult time switching to new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets into the new businesses. 根据此句可知，大公司不能进入新市场的原因是他们在开创新业务的过程中，依然不愿放弃现有的优势。接来下第五段用柯达的事例继续阐释了这句话的含义，即 too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future，沉溺于过去的辉煌，而不能完全拥抱未来。所以正确答案为D. They are deeply stuck in their glorious past.
65. A. A burden.
【解析】细节题。根据第五段最后一句话Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.可知柯达的历史已成自身发展的负担。burden是对liability的同义转换。所以正确答案为A。
66. C. Its refusal to sponsor the 1984 Olympics.
【解析】细节题。最后一段第一句说柯达在过去几十年间的衰败是戏剧性的。之后通过一个个例子来举例说明。从文中Kodak’s decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation.可知柯达犯的主要错误是没有赞助1984年的奥林匹克。而对手富士拿到了竞标，并由此赢得了市场上的永久立足点。所以正确答案为C。Part V     ClozeWhether you think you need daytime rest or not, picking up a nap habit—or continuing to make time for one—is a smart, healthy move. Consider the evidence: The Mayo Clinic says naps promote relaxation, reduced fatigue, better mood and alertness, and a sharper-working mind. A 2008 British study found that compared to getting more nighttime sleep or guzzling caffeine, a mid-day nap was the best way to cope with the mid-afternoon slump.
According to the Harvard Health Letter, several studies have shown that people remember new information better when they take a nap shortly after learning it. And, most incredibly, a 2007 study of nearly 24,000 Greek adults in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that people who napped regularly had a 37 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease compared to people who didn’t nap.
Of course, napping isn’t right for everyone. If you’re prone to insomnia, naps that are too long or taken too late in the day can interfere with your ability to fall or stay asleep at night. Also, people with certain sleep disorders, like sleep apnea or narcolepsy, may feel more tired if they take a nap than if they don’t.
But for most, naps can make you feel sharper and happier. Naps provide different benefits depending on how long they are, says MentalFloss.com. A 20-minute nap will boost alertness and concentration; a 90-minute snooze can enhance creativity.
According to Prevention.com, you experience a natural dip in body temperature between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. A power nap at this time can boost alertness forseveral hours and, for most people, shouldn’t affect being able to fall asleep at night.
Pick a dark, cozy place that’s not too warm or too chilly. Prevention.com recommends napping on the couch instead of in bed, so you’re less tempted to snooze for too long.
Surprisingly, the best place to crash may be a hammock if you have one. A Swiss study publishedlast year found that people fell asleep faster and had deeper sleep when they napped in a hammock than in a bed. That same rocking motion that lulls babies to sleep works wonders for grown-ups too.
点评：本篇完形填空摘自Read’s Digest， 再次体现了四六级考试频繁使用外刊素材的特点。
本篇文章主要讲述了睡午觉的好处。不管你是否觉得有睡午觉的必要，养成这样的习惯可以让你有效对抗下午的困顿。但是，睡午觉也未必适合每个人。如果你本身已经有失眠的问题，睡午觉会让你晚上更难入睡。
除了通过上下文理解才能得出答案的题目之外，仍然考察了一些语法点。比如第69题，A 2008 British study found that compared to getting more nighttime sleep, a mid-day nap was the best way to cope __69___ the mid-afternoon sleepiness. 这里明显考察的就是词组cope with.表示处理、应对。
再比如第73题，And most incredibly, a 2007 study of nearly 24,000 Greek adults in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that people who napped regularly had a 37% reduced risk of dying __73__ heart disease ……这里也非常明显的考察了词组die from
同时也考察了对动词词义的辨析。例如第77题，A 20-minute nap will boost alertness and concentration; a 90-minute snooze will __77___creativity.
选项包括了enlarge, engage, enhance 和enlighten. 根据前半句话的含义可知，20分钟午睡可以提高专注度，那么90分钟的午睡就更应该对创造力有益了。通过对4个选项的分析，只有enhance能够表达这个意思。此处除了要搞清楚4个选项本身的含义外，还要注意运用上下文来进行最终判断。
总体来说，整篇文章难度并不大，也没有出现过于生僻的表述方式。只要能够清楚辨析选项，熟悉搭配，并且充分理解上下文，就能够顺利完成本篇完形填空。Part VI    Translation87. Although only in her teens, my sister is looking forward to_________________（独自去海外学习）.

He was pale and disfigured and looked sick to death, which he probably was: obesity(肥胖的)leads to many nasty ways of dying. Looking around the carriage, I saw quite a few people like him, including a couple of fatty children with swollen checks pressing against their eyes. These people are part of what is without exaggeration an epidemic(流行病)of obesity.　　[B] But it is quite unnecessary: there is a simple idea- far from new- that could spare millions of such people a lifetime of chronic(长期的)ill health, and at the same time save the National Health Service(NHS)at least ￡14 billion a year in England and Wales. There would, you might think, be considerable public interest in it. This simple idea is that sugar is as good- or as bad- as poison and should be avoided. It is pure, white and deadly, as Professor John Yudkin described it 40 years ago in a revolutionary book of that name. The subtitle was How Sugar Is Killing Us.　　[C] In its countless hidden forms, in ready meals, junk food and sweet drinks, sugar leads to addiction(瘾), to hormonal upsets to the appetite, to metabolic(新陈代谢的)malfunctions and obesity and from there to type 2 diabetes(糖尿病)and its many horrible complication. If people really grasped that, they would try to kick the habit, particularly as  is the “ fat man of ” . They might even feel driven to support government measures to prevent people from consuming this deadly stuff. Yet so far this idea has met little but resistance.　　[D] It is not difficult to imagine the vested interests(既得利益集团)lined up against any sugar control- all the food and drink manufacturers, processors, promoters and retailers who make such easy pickings out of the magic powers of sugar. Then there are the liberals, with whom I would normally side, who protest that government regulation would be yet another instance of interference in our lives.　　[E]That is true, but people should realize that you cannot have a welfare state without a nanny state(保姆国家), to some degree. If we are all to be responsible for one another’s health insurance, through socialized medicine, then we are all closely involved in one another’s health, including everyone’s eating and drinking. That has already been admitted, finally, with smoking. But it has yet to be admitted with overeating, even though one in four adults in this country is obese and that number is predicted to double by the year 2050.Quite apart from anything else, obesity will cripple the NHS.　　[F]Recently, though, there have been signs that the medical establishment is trying to sound the alarm. Last month the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges(AMRC)published a report saying that obesity is the greatest public health issue affecting the  and urging government to do something.　　[G]The report offers 10 recommendations, of which the first is imposing a tax of 20 percent on sugary drinks for at least a year, on top of the existing 20 percent value-added tax. That at least would be an excellent start. The amounts of sugar in soft drinks are horrifying, and turn straight to fat. As Professor Terence Stephenson, head of the AMRC, has said, sugary soft drinks are “the ultimate bad food. You are just consuming neat sugar. Your body didn’t evolve to handle this kind of thing.”　　[H]Precisely. The risks of eating too much fat or salt(which are very different)pale into insignificant compared with the harm done by sugar. And it is everywhere.　　[I]It is difficult to buy anything in a supermarket, other than plain, unprepared meat, fish or vegetables, that doesn’t have a large amount of sugar in it. This has come about because the prevailing scientific views of the 1960s and 1970s ignored the evidence about sugar, and instead saw fat as the really serious risk, both to the heart and other organs, as well as the cause of obesity.　　[J]The fashion was to avoid fat. But finding that food with much of its fat removed is not very appetizing, food producers turned to sugar as a magic alternative flavor enhancer, often in the forms of syrups(糖浆)that had recently been developed from corn, and put it generously into most prepared foods and soft drinks.　　[K]This stuff is not just fattening. It is addictive. It interferes with the body’s metabolism, possibly via the activity of an appetite-controlling hormone. There’s plenty of evidence for this, for those who will accept the truth.　　[L]Theoretically, people ought to make “healthy choices” and avoid overeating. But sugar additives are not easy to identify and are hard to avoid. So the snacking, over-drinking and over eating that makes people fat is not really their own fault: obesity is in large part something that is being done to them. It should be stopped, or rather the government should stop it.　　[M]Going round my local supermarket, I am constantly astonished that it is still legal to sell all the poisons stacked high on the shelves. The problem is that they are worse than useless. They are poisonous. They are known to be addictive. They are known to make people obese. And giving small children sweet drinks or bottles of fake juice all day long is nothing less than child abuse.　　[N]Clearly, the sale of such stuff ought to be illegal. I hate to think of yet more government regulation. But a bit of tax on sweet soda and a little more health education, a bit of cooking in schools and banning vending machines(自动售货机)here and there — as suggested try the AMRC report — is not going to achieve very much. Labelling is quite inadequate. What is needed is legislation banning high levels of sugary syrups used in foods and drinks.　　[O]In June 2012, the then minister for public health said the government was not scared of the food industry and had not ruled out legislation, because of the costs of obesity to the NHS. However, nothing has happened yet. Why not have another Jammie Dodger biscuit and forget about it.46、Avoiding over-consumption of sugar can improve people’s health as well as save medical expenses. 
47、Laws should be passed to make it illegal to produce overly sweet foods or drinks.
48、Giving small children sweet juices to drink all the time is equal to child abuse.
59、Looking around, the author found obesity quite widespread.
50、The number of obese people is expected to increase quickly in the next few decades.
51、If people really understood the horrible consequences of sugary foods and drinks, they would support government measures against sugar consumption.
52、It would be a very good beginning wo improve an additional tax on sugary drinks.
53、The government has not yet taken any action to regulate sugar consumption although it indicated its intention to do so some time ago.
54、Sugar is far more harmful to health than fat and salt.
55、Consumers of sweet foods are not really to blame because they cannot tell what food is sugary.Section C
　　Directions：There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 　　The rise of the Internet has been one of the most transformative developments in human history, comparable in impact to the invention of the printing press and the telegraph. Over two billion people worldwide now have access to vastly more information than ever before, and can communicate with each other instantly, often using Web-connected mobile devices they carry everywhere. But the Internet’s tremendous impacts has only just begun. 
 　　“Mass adoption of the Internet is driving one of the most exciting social, cultural, and political transformations in history, and unlike earlier periods of change, this time the effects are fully global,” Schmidt and Cohen write in their new book. The New Digital Age. 
　　Perhaps the most profound changes will come when the five billion people worldwide who currently lack Internet access get online. The authors do an excellent job of examining the implications of the Internet revolution for individuals, governments, and institutions like the news media. But if the book has one major shortcoming, it’s that authors don’t spend enough time applying a critical eye to the role of Internet businesses in these weeping changes. 
　　In their book, the authors provide the most authoritative volume to date that describes — and more importantly predicts — how the Internet will shape our lives in the coming decades. They paint a picture of a world in which individuals, companies, institutions, and governments must deal with two realities, one physical, and one virtual. 
　　At the core of the book is the idea that “technology is neutral, but people aren’t.” By using this concept as a starting point, the authors aim to move beyond the now familiar optimist vs. pessimist dichotomy(对立观点)that has characterized many recent debates about whether the rise of the Internet will ultimately be good or bad for society. In an interview with TIME earlier this week, Cohen said although he and his co-author are optimistic about many aspects of the Internet, they’re also realistic about the risks and dangers that lie ahead when the next five billion people come online, particularly with respect to personal privacy and state surveillance(监视).　　56、In what way is the rise of the Internet similar to the invention of the printing press and the telegraph? 
　　A.It transforms human history. 
　　B.It facilitates daily communication. 
　　C.It is adopted by all humanity. 
　　D.It revolutionizes people's thinking.
　　57、How do Schmidt and Cohen describe the effects of the Internet? 
　　A.They are immeasurable. 
　　B.They are worldwide. 
　　C.They are unpredictable. 
　　D.They are contaminating.
　　58、In what respect is the book The New Digital Age considered inadequate? 
　　A.It fails to recognize the impact of the Internet technology. 
　　B.It fails to look into the social implications of the Internet. 
　　C.It lacks an objective evaluation of the role of Internet businesses. 
　　D.It does not address the technical aspects of Internet communication.
　　59、What will the future be like when everybody gets online? 
　　A.People will be living in two different realities. 
　　B.People will have equal access to information. 
　　C.People don’t have to travel to see the world. 
　　D.People don’t have to communicate face to face.
　　60、What does the passage say about the authors of The New Digital Age? 
　　A.They leave many questions unanswered concerning the Internet. 
　　B.They are optimistic about the future of the Internet revolution. 
　　C.They have explored the unknown territories of the virtual world. 
　　D.They don’t take sides in analyzing the effects of the Internet.　　In 1950, a young man would have found it much easier than it is today to get and keep a job in the auto industry. And in that year the average autoworker could meet monthly mortgage(抵押贷款)payments on an average home with just 13.4 percent of his take-home pay. Today a similar mortgage would claim more than twice that share of his monthly eamings. 
　　Other members of the autoworker’s family, however might be less inclined to tried the present for the past. His retired parents would certainly have had less economic security back then. Through-out much of the 1960s,more than a quarter of men and women and women age 65 and older lived below the poverty level, compared to less than 10 percent in 2010. 
　　In most stales, his wife could not have taken out a loan or a card in her own name. In 42 states, a homemaker had no legal claim on the earnings of her husband. And nowhere did a wife have legal protection against family violence. 
　　Most black workers would not want to return to a time when, on average they earned 40 percent less than their white counterparts(职位相当的人),white racially restrictive agreements largely prevented them from buying into the suburban neighborhoods being built for white working –class families. 
Today, new problems have emerged in the process of resolving old ones, but the solution is not to go back to the past. Some people may long for an era when divorce was still hard to come by. The spread of no -fault divorce has reduced the bargaining power of whichever spouse is more interested in continuing the relationship. And the breakup of such marriages has caused pain for many families. 
　　The growing diversity of family life comes with new possibilities as well as new challenges. According to a recent poll, more than 80 percent of Americans believe that their current family is as close as the one in which they grew up, or closer. Finding ways to imaginary golden age. 　　61、What do we learn about American autoworkers in 1950?

　　B.It was not too difficult for them to buy a house. 
　　C.Their earnings were worth twice as much as today. 
　　D.They were better off than workers in other industries.
　　62、What does the author about retired people today? 
　　A.They invariably long to return to the golden past. 
　　B.They do not depend so much on social welfare. 
　　C.They feel more secure economically than in the past. 
　　D.They are usually unwilling to live with their children.
　　63、Why couldn’t black workers buy a house in a whitc suburban neighborhood ? 
　　A.They lacked the means of transportation. 
　　B.They were subjected to racial inequality.

　　C.Narrow the gap between blacks and whites. 
　　D.Improve the lives of families with problemsPart IV Translation

　　When it comes to “what campus activity that has benefited you most”,I can’t help remembering the change4life campaign. This campus activity rallies us to protect our physical health. 
　　There are,to my mind,plenty of identifiable factors.To begin with, this campus activity has informed me that physical health is most precious to us. Nothing can replace with our fitness. What’s more, this campus campaign holds varieties of health clubs, which give me numerous tips on how to keep our fitness. Last but not least, by taking part in this campus activity, I develop some good habit. For example, every morning, I run for a while. Again, Ispend the bulk of every weekend on climbing . 
　　Therefore, I confirm that the change4life campaign is the campus activity that has benefited me most.If it had not been,I could not have enjoyed my health. 　　【印象最深的课程：参考范文】
　　When it comes to a course that leaves the deepest impression in university, different people stand on different grounds. As for me, the most impressive course in college is “Appreciation of English Movies”, which I like best. I prefer this curriculum to others owing to the following factors.
　　On one hand, the professor in charge of this course has impressed me most because she is not only knowledgeable but also patient. More importantly, it is this respectable teacher who spurs my interest to English harder and broadens my horizon as well. Until now, what she said in the class often occurs to my mind. On the other hand, there are many discussions in the classroom when we have lessons. We are allowed to talk freely about a movie, the topic ranging from the theme of a film to its casting. So, during the talk, we become increasingly open-minded. And undoubtedly a brain open to everything carries great importance to study, work and life. 
　　Generally speaking, the course on appreciating English films has impressed me most for it is not only instructive but also entertaining. And therefore, I suggest that more similar courses should be offered in the university.   　　【印象最深的同学：参考范文】

For example, a Colombian who wants someone to (27)______ him often signals with a hand movement in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped, point downward as they move rapidly (28)_______. Speakers or English have a similar gesture through the hand may not be cupped and the fingers may be held more loosely, but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away, quite the (29)______ of the Colombian gesture. Again, in Colombian, a speaker of English would have to know that when he (30)________ height he most choose between different gestures depending on whether he is (31)_______ a human being or an animal. If he keeps the palm of the hand (32)_________ the floor, as he would in his own culture when making known the height of a child, for example, he will very likely be greeted by laughter, in Colombia this gesture is (33)_________ for the description of animals. In order to describe human beings he should keep the palm of his hand (34)_________ to the floor. Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create not only humorous but also (35)________ moment. In both of the examples above, speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically, but its meaning differs sharply.   Part III Reading Comprehension (40 minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks.

Part of the warming is natural; we have experienced a 20,000 -year -long warming as the last ice age ended and the ice 36 away. However, we have already reached temperatures that are in 37 with other minimum-ice periods, so continued warming is likely not natural. We are 38 to a predicted worldwide increase in temperatures 39 between  and  over the next 100 years. The warming will be more  some areas, less in others, and some places may even cool off. Likewise, the 41 of this warming will be very different depending on where you are—coastal areas must worry about rising sea levels, while Siberia and northern Canada may become more habitable (宜居的) and 42 for humans than these areas are now.The fact remains, however, that it will likely get warmer, on 43 , everywhere. Scientists are in general agreement that the warmer conditions we have been experiencing are at least in part the result of a human-induced global warming trend. Some scientists 44 that the changes we are seeing fall within the range of random (无规律的) variation—some years are cold, others warm, and we have just had an unremarkable string of warm years 45 —but that is becoming an increasingly rare interpretation in the face of continued and increasing warm conditions. 注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。Section BDirections: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.The End of the Book?[A] Amazon, by far the largest bookseller in the country, reported on May 19 that it is now selling more books in its electronic Kindle format than in the old paper-and-ink format. That is remarkable, considering that the Kindle has only been around for four years. E-books now account for 14 percent of all book sales in the country and are increasing far faster than overall book sales. E-book sales are up 146 percent over last year, while hardback sales increased 6 percent and paperbacks decreased 8 percent.[B] Does this spell the doom of the physical book? Certainly not immediately, and perhaps not at all. What it does mean is that the book business will go through a transformation in the next decade or so more profound than any it has seen since Gutenberg introduced printing from moveable type in the 1450s.[C] Physical books will surely become much rarer in the marketplace. Mass market paperbacks, which have been declining for years anyway, will probably disappear, as will hardbacks for mysteries, thrillers, “romance fiction,” etc. Such books, which only rarely end up in permanent collections, either private or public, will probably only be available as e-books within a few years. Hardback and trade paperbacks for “serious” nonfiction and fiction will surely last longer. Perhaps it will become the mark of an author to reckon with that he or she is still published in hard copy.[D] As for children’s books, who knows? Children’s books are like dog food in that the purchasers are not the consumers, so the market (and the marketing) is inherently strange.[E] For clues to the book’s future, let’s look at some examples of technological change and see what happened to the old technology.[F] One technology replaces another only because the new technology is better, cheaper, or both. The greater the difference, the sooner and more thoroughly the new technology replaces the old. Printing with moveable type on paper dramatically reduced the cost of producing a book compared with the old-fashioned ones handwritten on vellum, which comes from sheepskin. A Bible—to be sure, a long book—required vellum made from 300 sheepskins and countless man-hours of labor. Before printing arrived, a Bible cost more than a middle-class house. There were perhaps 50,000 books in all of  in 1450. By 1500 there were 10 million.[G] But while printing quickly caused the hand written book to die out, handwriting lingered on (继续存在) well into the 16th century. Very special books are still occasionally produced on vellum, but they are one-of-a-kind show pieces.[H]Sometimes a new technology doesn’t drive the old one out, but only parts of it while forcing the rest to evolve. The movies were widely predicted to drive live theater out of the marketplace, but they didn’t, because theater turned out to have qualities movies could not reproduce. Equally, TV was supposed to replace movies but, again, did not.[I] Movies did, however, fatally impact some parts of live theater. And while TV didn’t kill movies, it did kill second-rate pictures, shorts, and cartoons.[J] Nor did TV kill radio. Comedy and drama shows (“Jack Benny,” “Amos and Andy,” “The Shadow”) all migrated to television. But because you can’t drive a car and watch television at the same time, rush hour became radio’s prime, while music, talk, and news radio greatly enlarged their audiences. Radio is today a very different business than in the late 1940s and a much larger one.[K] Sometimes old technology lingers for centuries because of its symbolic power. Mounted cavalry (骑兵) replaced the chariot (二轮战车) on the battlefield around 1000 BC. But chariots maintained their place in parades and triumphs right up until the end of the  1,500 years later. The sword hasn’t had a military function for a hundred years, but is still part of an officer’s full-dress uniform, precisely because a sword always symbolized “an officer and a gentleman.”[L] Sometimes new technology is a little cranky (不稳定的) at first. Television repairman was a common occupation in the 1950s, for instance. And so the old technology remains as a backup. Steamships captured the  passenger business from sail in the 1840s because of its much greater speed. But steamships didn’t lose their sails until the 1880s, because early marine engines had a nasty habit of breaking down. Until ships became large enough (and engines small enough) to mount two engines side by side, they needed to keep sails. (The high cost of steam and the lesser need for speed kept the majority of the world’s ocean freight moving by sail until the early years of the 20th century.)[M] Then there is the fireplace. Central heating was present in every upper-and middle-class home by the second half of the 19th century. But functioning fireplaces remain to this day a powerful selling point in a house or apartment. I suspect the reason is a deep-rooted love of the fire. Fire was one of the earliest major technological advances for humankind, providing heat, protection, and cooked food (which is much easier to cat and digest). Human control of fire goes back far enough (over a million years) that evolution could have produced a genetic leaning towards fire as a central aspect of human life.[N] Books—especially books the average person could afford—haven’t been around long enough to produce evolutionary change in humans. But they have a powerful hold on many people nonetheless, a hold extending far beyond their literary content. At their best, they are works of art and there is a tactile（触觉的）pleasure in books necessarily lost in e-book versions. The ability to quickly thumb through pages is also lost. And a room with books in it induces, at least in some, a feeling not dissimilar to that of a fire in the fireplace on a cold winter’s night.[O] For these reasons I think physical books will have a longer existence as a commercial product than some currently predict. Like swords, books have symbolic power. Like fireplaces, they induce a sense of comfort and warmth. And, perhaps, similar to sails, they make a useful back-up for when the lights go out.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。46. Authors still published in printed versions will be considered important ones.47.

For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 56 to 60are based on the following passage.The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education isn’t an either/or proposition(命题)，although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM（science, technology, engineering, maths）-related fields can make it seem that way.The latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training, but also asserts that the study of the humanities (人文学科)and social sciences must remain central components of America’s educational system at all levels. Both are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society, become innovative（创新的)leaders, and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the great ideas of mankind over time provides.Parents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates’ job prospects as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs. Under these circumstances, it’s natural to look for what may appear to be the most “practical” way out of the problem “Major in a subject designed to get you a job” seems the obvious answer to some, though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as “soft” often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run. Indeed, according to surveys, employers have expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well, think critically, research creatively, and communicate easily.Moreover, students should be prepared not just for their first job, but for their 4th and 5th jobs, as there’s little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers. The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to be flexible. The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight—picked up from science, arts, and technology—to solve the problems of the future, and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, will be helpful to them and the .注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。56.

It has a nice ring to it. Doesn’t it? If you think so, you’re not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession.“Energy independence” and its rhetorical (修辞的) companion “energy security” are, however, slippery concepts that are rarely though through. What is it we want independence from, exactly?Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that old from elsewhere.The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle（涓涓细流）of biofuel（生物燃料）available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.Second, Americans have basically decided that they don’t really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the  are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to endure the environmental impacts of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports?Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don’t read about this much, the  is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.There is no question that the  imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to maintain its economy. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices, At the same time, we derive massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。61.

economic indicators show the world is 26 Despite a slow start at the beginning of the eighties, global economic output increased by more than a fifth during the 27 The economy grew, trade increased, and millions of new jobs were created.How can biological indicators show the 28 of economic indicators?The answer is that the economic indicators have a basic fault: they show no difference between resource uses that 29 progress and those uses that will hurt it.The main measure of economic progress is the gross national product (GNP). 30 , this totals the value of all goods and services produced and subtracts loss in value of factories and equipment.Developed a half-century ago, GNP helped 31 a common way among countries of measuring change in economic output.For some time, this seemed to work 32 well, but serious weaknesses are now appearing.As indicated earlier, GNP includes loss in value of factories and equipment, but it does not 33 the loss of natural resources, including nonrenewable resources such as oil or renewable resources such as forests.This basic fault can produce a 34 sense of national economic health.According to GNP, for example, countries that overcut forests actually do better than those that preserve their forests.The trees cut down are counted as income but no subtraction is made for 35 the forests.Part Ⅲ  Reading Comprehension  ( 40

great educators for the students who need them most."All children are 37 to a high-quality education regardless of their race, zip code or family income.It is 38 important that we provide teachers and principals the support they need to help students reach their full 39 ," U.S.Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said." Despite the excellent work and deep 40 of our nation's teachers and principals, students in high-poverty, high- minority schools are unfairly treated across our country.We have to do better.Local leaders and educators will 41 their own creative solutions, but we must work together to 42 our focus on how to better recruit, support and 43 effective teachers and principals for all students, especially the kids who need them most."Today's announcement is another important step forward in improving access to a quality education, a 44 of President Obama's year of action.Later today, Secretary Duncan will lead a roundtable discussion with principals and school teachers from across the country about the 45 of working in high-need schools and how to adopt promising practices for supporting great educators in these schools.AnnouncingB.beneficialC.challengesD.commitment E.component F.contestsG.critically H.developI.distributing J.enhanceK.entitledL.potential M.properly N.qualified O.retainSection BDirections: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.Eachstatement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived.You may choose a paragraph more than once.Each paragraph is marked with a letter.Answer the questions by marking thecorresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.The Changes Facing Fast FoodA.Fast-food firms have to be a thick-skinned bunch.Health experts regularly criticise them severelyfor selling food that makes people fat.Critics even complain that McDonald's, whose logosymbolises calorie excess, should not have been allowed to sponsor the World Cup.These arethings fast-food firms have learnt to cope with.But not perhaps for much longer.The burgerbusiness faces more pressure from regulators at a time when it is already adapting strategies inresponse to shifts in the global economy.B)Fast food was once thought to be recession-proof.When consumers need to cut spending, the logicgoes, cheap meals like Big Macs and Whoppers become even more attractive.Such "trading down"proved true for much of the latest recession, when fast-food companies picked up customers who could no longer afford to eat at casual restaurants.Traffic was boosted in America, the home of fast food, with discounts and promotions, such as $1 menus and cheap combination meals.C)As a result, fast-food chains have weathered the recession better than their more expensive competitors.In 2009 sales at full-service restaurants in America fell by more than 6% , but total sales remained about the same at fast-food chains.In some markets, such as Japan, France and Britain, total spending on fast food increased.Same-store sales in America at McDonald's, the world's largest fast-food company, did not decline throughout the downturn.Panera Bread, an American fast-food chain known for its fresh ingredients, performed well, too, because it offers higher-quality food at lower prices than restaurants.D)But not all fast-food companies have been as fortunate.Many, such as Burger King, have seen sales fall.In a severe recession, while some people trade down to fast food, many others eat at home more frequently to save money.David Palmer, an analyst at UBS, a bank, says smaller fast- food chains in America, such as Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr., have been hit particularly hard in this downturn because they are competing with the global giant McDonald's, which increased spending on advertising by more than 7% last year as others cut back.E.Some fast-food companies also sacrificed their own profits by trying to give customers better value.During the recession companies set prices low, hoping that once they had tempted customers through the door they would be persuaded to order more expensive items.But in many cases that strategy did not work.Last year Burger King franchisees (特许经营人)sued (起诉)the company over its double-cheeseburger promotion, claiming it was unfair for them to be repuired to sell these for $1 when they cost$1.10 to make.In May a judge ruled in favour of Burger King.Nevertheless, the company may still be cursing its decision to promote cheap choices over more expensive ones because items on its "value menu" now account for around 20% of all sales, upfrom 12% last October.F.Analysts expect the fast-food industry to grow modestly this year.But the downturn is makingcompanies rethink their strategies.Many are now introducing higher-priced items to entice (引诱)consumers away from $1 specials.KFC, a division of Yum! Brands, which also owns Taco Belland Pizza Hut, has launched a chicken sandwich that costs around $5.And in May Burger Kingintroduced barbecue (烧烤)pork ribs at $7 for eight.G.Companies are also trying to get customers to buy new and more items, including drinks.McDonald's started selling better coffee as a challenge to Starbucks.Its " McCafe" line nowaccounts for an estimated 6% of sales in America.Starbucks has sold rights to its Seattle's Bestcoffee brand to Burger King, which will start selling it later this year.H.As fast-food companies shift from "super size" to "more buys", they need to keep customer traffichigh throughout the day.Many see breakfast as a big opporttmity, and not just for fatty food.McDonald's will start selling porridge (粥)in America next year.Breakfast has the potential to bevery profitable, says Sara Senatore of Bernstein, a research firm, because the margins can be high.Fast-food companies are also adding midday and late-night snacks, such as blended drinks andwraps.The idea is that by having a greater range of things on the menu, "we can sell to consumersproducts they want all day," says Rick Carucci., the .chief financial officer of Yum ! Brands.I.But what about those growing waistlines? So far, fast-food firms have cleverly avoided governmentregulation.By providing healthy options, like salads and low-calorie sandwiches, they have at leastgiven the impression of doing something about helping to fight obesity (肥胖症).These offeringsare not necessarily loss-leaders, as they broaden the appeal of outlets to groups of diners thatinclude some people who don't want to eat a burger.But customers cannot be forced to ordersalads instead of fries.J.In the future, simply offering a healthy option may not be good enough."Every packaged-food and restaurant company I know is concerned about regulation right now," says Mr.Palmer of UBS.America's health-reform bill, which Congress passed this year, requires restaurant chains with 20 ormore outlets to put the calorie-content of items they serve on the menu.A study by the NationalBureau of Economic Research, which tracked the effects on Starbucks of a similar calorie-postinglaw in New York City in 2007, found that the average calorie-count per transaction fell 6% andrevenue increased 3% at Starbucks stores where a Dunldn Donuts outlet was nearby--a sign, it issaid, that menu-labelling could favour chains that have more healthy offerings.K.In order to avoid other legislation in America and elsewhere, fast-food companies will have tocontinue innovating (创新).Walt Riker of McDonald's claims the change it has made in its menumeans it offers more healthy items than it did a few years ago."We probably sell more vegetables,more milk, more salads, more apples than any restaurant business in the world," he says.But therecent proposal by a county in California to ban McDonald's from including toys in its high-calorie"Happy Meals", because legislators believe it attracts children to unhealthy food, suggests there isa lot more left to do.46.Some people propose laws be made to stop McDonald's from attaching toys to its food specials for children.47.Fast-food finns may not be able to cope with pressures from food regulation in the near future.48.Burger King will start to sell Seattle's Best coffee to increase sales.49.Some fast-food firms provide healthy food to give the impression they are helping to tackle the obesity problem.During the recession, many customers turned to fast food to save money.51.Many people eat out less often to save money in times of recession.52.During the recession, Burger King's promotional strategy of offering low-priced items often proved ineffective.53.Fast-food restaurants can make a lot of money by selling breakfast.54.Many fast-food companies now expect to increase their revenue by introducing higher-priced items.55.A newly-passed law asks big fast-food chains to specify the calorie count of what they serve on the menu.Section CDirections: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions orunfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A., B), C.andD ).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on AnswerSheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.If you think a high-factor sunscreen (防晒霜)keeps you safe from harmful rays, you may be wrong.Research in this week's Nature shows that while factor 50 reduces the number of melanomas(黑瘤)and delays their occurrence, it can't prevent them.Melanomas are the most aggressive skin cancers.You have a higher risk if you have red or blond hair, fair skin, blue or green eyes, or sunburn easily, or if a close relative has had one.Melanomas are more common if you have periodic intense exposure to the sun.Other skin cancers are increasingly likely with long-term exposure.There is continuing debate as to how effective sunscreen is in reducing melanomas  the evidence is weaker than it is for preventing other types of skin cancer.A 2011 Australian study of 1,621 people found that people randomly selected to apply sunscreen daily had half the rate of melanomas of people who used cream as needed.A second study, comparing 1,167 people with melanomas to 1,101 who didn't have the cancer, found that using sunscreen routinely, alongside other protection such as hats,long sleeves or staying in the shade, did give some protection.This study said other forms of sun protection  not sunscreen  seemed most beneficial.The study relied on people remembering what they had done over each decade of their lives, so it's not entirely reliable.But it seems reasonable to think sunscreen gives people a false sense of security in the sun.Many people also don't use sunscreen properly  applying insufficient amounts, failing to reapply after a couple of hours and staying in the sun too long.It is sunburn that is most worrying  recent research shows five episodes of sunburn in the teenage years increases the risk of all skin cancers.The good news is that a combination of sunscreen and covering up can reduce melanoma rates, as shown by Australian figures from their slip-slop-slap campaign.So if there is a heat wave this summer, it would be best for us, too, to slip on a shirt, slop on (抹上)sunscreen and slap on a hat.56.What is people's common expectation of a high-factor sunscreen?A.It will delay the occurrence of skin cancer.B.It will protect them from sunburn.C.It will keep their skin smooth and fair.D.It will work for people of any skin color.57.What does the research in Nature say about a high-factor sunscreen?A.It is ineffective in preventing melanomas.B.It is ineffective in case of intense sunlight.C.It is ineffective with long-term exposure.D.It is ineffective for people with fair skin.58.What do we learn from the 2011 Australian study of 1,621 people?A.Sunscreen should be applied alongside other protection measures.B.High-risk people benefit the most from the application of sunscreen.C.Irregular application of sunscreen does women more harm than good.D.Daily application of sunscreen helps reduce the incidence of melanomas.59.What does the author say about the second Australian study?A.It misleads people to rely on sunscreen for protection.B.It helps people to select the most effective sunscreen.C.It is not based on direct observation of the subjects.D.It confirms the results of the first Australian study.60.What does the author suggest to reduce melanoma rates?A.Using both covering up and sunscreen.B.Staying in the shade whenever possible.C.Using covering up instead of sunscreen.D.Applying the right amount of sunscreen.Passage TwoQuestions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled.Some65% of American men aged 62 -74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with32% of men with only a high-school certificate.This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-educated well-off and the unskilled poor.Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled.The consequences, for individuals and society, are profound.The world is facing an astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before.Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion.The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity (长寿)translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems.But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled.Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer.The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人)are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce.Policy is partly responsible.Many European governments have abandoned policies that used to encourage people to retire early.Rising life expectancy (预期寿命), combined with the replacement of generous defmed-benefit pension plans with less generous defined-contribution ones, means that even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement.But the changing nature of work also plays a big role.Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation.Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management knowhow to creativity, do not necessarily decline with age.61.What is happening in the workforce in rich countries?A.Younger people are replacing the elderly.B.Well-educated people tend to work longer.C.Unemployment rates are rising year after year.D.People with no college degree do not easily find work.62.What has helped deepen the divide between the well-off and the poor?A.Longer life expectancies.B.A rapid technological advance.C.Profound changes in the workforce.D.A growing number of the well-educated.63.What do many observers predict in view of the experience of the 20th century?A.Economic growth will slow down.B.Government budgets will increase.C.More people will try to pursue higher education.D.There will be more competition in the job market.64.What is the result of policy changes in European countries?A.Unskilled workers may choose to retire early.B.More people have to receive in-service training.C.Even wealthy people must work longer to live comfortably in retirement.D.People may be able to enjoy generous defined-benefits from pension plans.65.What is characteristic of work in the 21st century?A.Computers will do more complicated work.B.More will be taken by the educated young.C.Most jobs to be done will be the creative ones.D.Skills are highly valued regardless of age.Part Ⅳ   Translation   ( 30 minutes)Directions: For this

Ⅰ Writing这是一篇四级考试中常见的议论文。此次通过漫画所呈现出的话题phone(手机)是考生日常生活中熟悉的话题，因此写起来并不难。考生应该将重点放在第二段阐述手机与日常学习的关系上。联系实际分析可知二者关系为：手机为日常学习带来了便利条件，但不能完全取代校园学习。一、提出观点：手机在学习中虽然重要但并非必不可少(play an imoortant but not indispensable role)二、论证观点三、总结观点手机在学习中的作用漫画生动地描述了一个小学生问他的母亲，既然他的手机已经无所不知，为什么还要去上学。这幅漫画揭示了这样一个现象：一些学生高度依赖手机，而忽视了个人学习的重要性。然而，我认为，手机在学生们的学习中虽然重要但并非必不可少。毫无疑问，手机给我们带来了很多便利，但是在学习过程中，我们不应该过度依赖手机。首先，我们自身应该具有很好的知识储备以应对没有手机在手边时的各种情况。其次，正是我们的个人知识促进了手机的发展。如果没有学校的基础教育，就没有手机的问世。总而言之，过度依赖手机弊大于利。因此，我们应该合理地平衡手机与学习的关系。只有这样我们才能够从学习过程中获得最大的收益。W:I'm going to give up playing chess.I lost again today.M:Just because you lost? Is that any reaSon to quit?Q:What does the man imply?D)。选项中多次出现game和play chess，可以推测对话内容与下象棋有关。另外，从四个选项的内容审可以椎测，对话讲的府该县女士想放弃下象棋，男士给出建议或指导。本题的关键在于听懂反问句和反问的语调。女士说因为今天又输了，所以打算放弃下象棋。男士没有正面回应，而是反问了两句：Just because you lost?Is that any reaSon to quit?”仅仅是因为输了吗?那能算是放弃的理由吗?”言外之意就是不该放弃。换句话说就是，男士建议女士继续下棋。故本题答案为D)。2.M：Do you know Sally’s new address?She S got Some mall nere，anu I’d liKe to forward it to her.W：Well，we've not been in touch for quite a while.Let’s see.Mary should know it.Q：What does the woman mean?C)。选项中出现了mail，address和contact等词，可以推测对话内容和邮件有关：由选项中的玛丽和萨利两个人名可知对话的内容涉及另外两个人，人物较多，听录音时应注意区分人物之间的关系，做好标记；另外，选项A)以the mail作主语，选项B)和D)以she作主语，可以推测该题会从女士的角度提问，女士的话为听音重点。本题的关键在于听到细节“Mary should know it.”男士想把萨利的邮件转寄给她，问女士是否知道她的地址。女士说自己很久没跟萨利联系了，但是结尾补充了一句：“玛丽应该知道地址。”故本题答案为C)。W：I missed classes this morning.Could you please lend me your notes?M：My notes?You've never seen my handwriting,have you?Q：What does the man imply?B)。选项中出现了handwriting，notes和class等词，可以推测对话内容应该与上课做笔记有关。另外，四个选项中，A)和B)以his开头，C)和D)以he为主语，可以推测该题会从男士的角度提问，男士的话为听音重点。解题的关键是听懂反意疑问句。女士想要借男士的笔记看，男士没有正面回答，而是反问道：You've never seen my handwriting，have you?“你没看过我的笔迹，对吗?”言外之意就是自己的笔迹难以辨认，不易读懂。故本题答案为B)。M：I'm taking my girlfriend to the fancy new restaurant for her birthday tonight.W：1 went there last weekend.I found it rather disappointing.Q：What does the woman mean?A)。四个选项中反复出现了choose和restaurant等词，由此推测对话内容与选择饭店有关。另外，选项A)和D)均是讲男士选择饭店，而选项B)和C)则出现了dating和her，故可推测该题可能是从女士的角度看待男士所选择的饭店，女士的话为听音重点。男士说今晚要带女朋友去新开的饭店过生日。女士说她上周去过，太让她失望了。从rather disaDpointing可以听出女士话语中强烈的否定意味，言外之意就是建议男士不要去这家饭店了，应该另选一家。故本题答案为A)。W：Winter is over at last.Time to put away my gloves and boots.M：I've been waiting for this for months.Q：What does the man mean?A)。四个选项中三个都提到了季节，由此推测对话内容可能与季节有关。另外，四个选项都是以he开头，故可判断该题会从男士的角度进行提问，男士的话为听音重点。女士说，冬天终于结束了，可以把手套和靴子收起来了。男士回应说为此他已经等了好几个月了。显然男士和女士一样非常期待冬天的结束，也就是盼望春天的到来。故本题答案为A)。6.W：Thank you for bnnging the books back.M：I thought you need them over the weekend.Many thanks for letting me use them. Q：What do we learn from the conversation?B).四个选项中，A)和D)以the woman为主语，B)和C)以the man为主语，选项在内容上较分散，可以推测该题并非针对男士或女士个人的话提问，而是考查对整个对话的理解，听音时应注意从全局把握对话内容。对话开头，女士对男士说，谢谢他把书送回来，由此可知应该是男士借了女士的书，故首先排除C)项：男士说，他认为女士周末会用到，而且感谢女士让他使用这些书，故本题选择B)。7.W：Are you working flexible hours?M：N0，I'm not.The weather today is So nice，So I decided to walk to work，and that meant I had to leavean hour earlier than usual.Q：What did the mail decide to do?。选项中涉及work，on foot，trip和walk等词，可推测对话和步行上班或旅行相关。四个选项均为动词短语，由此可推断该题会对建议或计划进行提问，应特别注意和建议或计划相关的表述。女士问男士的工作时间是否可以变通，男士回答说，不能。但今天天气很好，他决定步行去上班。所以必须比平常早一个小时出发。男士话语中有明显的表示计划的动词decided，其后的内容就是本题的答案，故答案为A)。8.W：Our plane has been circling for a long time.Why the delay?M：The airport Was closed for a while this morning，and things are still not back to normal。Q：What does the man mean?C)。四个选项均涉及飞机和机场，而且都和机场存在的问题有关，故听音的重点为机场在哪方面出现了问题。女士问，飞机已经盘旋了很长时间，为什么会延迟。男士回答说，机场早晨关闭了一段时间，而且仍然没有恢复正常：由此可知，机场出现的问题是closed for a while，而选项C)中的temporaryclosing正是该表述的同义转述，故本题答案为C)。Conversation OneW:Good Morning, this is TGC!M:Good morning, Walter Barry here, calling from London.Could I speak to Mr.Grand, please? W:Who's calling, please?M:Walter Barry, from London.W:What is it about, please?M :Well, (9) I understand that your company has a chemical processing plant.My own company LCP, LiquidControl Products, is a leader in safety from leaks in the field of chemical processing.( 10 ) I'd like to speakto Mr.Grand to discuss ways in which we could help TGC to protect itself from such problems and savemoney at the same time.W:Yes, I see.Well, Mr.Grand is not available just now.M:Can you tell me when I could reach him?W :He's very busy for the next few days.Then he'll be away in New York.So it's difficult to give you a time.M:Could I speak to Someone else, perhaps?W:Who, in particular?M:A colleague, for example?W:(11) You are speaking to his perSonal assistant.I can deal with calls for Mr.Grand.M:Yes, well, could I ring him tomorrow?W:No, I'm Sorry.He won't be free tomorrow.Listen, let me suggest Something.(12) You send us details ofyour products and services, together with references from other companies.And then we'll contact you.M:Yes, that's very kind of you.I have your address.W:Very good, Mr?M:Barry.Walter Barry, from LCP in London.W:Right, Mr.Barry.We look forward to hearing from you.M:Thank you, goodbye.W :Bye.预览四道题各选项，由选项中}H现的partnership，plant，salesman，chemist，director，assistant， department和products等词可以推测，本文和商业有关，可能涉及公司之间的合作或产品的推销。结合第l0题和第ll题各选项，应注意对话中对人物身份的描述，结合第l2题的选项可推测该对话可能是电话对话。9.What do we learn about the woman’s company?D)。由对话开头可知，男士在给女士打电话，女士问男士有什么事情，男士在说明来电目的前说，自己了解到女士的公司有家化学加工厂，故D)为答案。10.What do we learn about the man?C)。对话中，男士先表明自己的身份，介绍了自己公司，说明了来电目的是想和格兰德先生讨论如何帮助TGC公司防止泄漏，同时节省开支的问题，实际上就是要推荐自己公司的产品，由此可推断男士是一名销售员，故C)为答案。11.What is the woman’s position in her company?B)。对话中，女士告知男士格兰德先生非常忙，没空与男士说话，男士想找其他人商谈，女士告诉他，他正和格兰德先生的私人助理说话，即女士就是格兰德先生的私人助理，故B)为答案。12.What does the woman suggest the man do?C)。对话中，女士说let me suggest Something，由此可知，其后就是女士对男士的建议，即为该题的答案。对话中，女士建议男士将其公司产品和服务的详情以及其他公司的推荐信一并寄送过来，之后会和男士联系，故C)为答案。Conversation  TwoM:Miss Yamada,( 13 ) did you ever think that you would find yourself living and working in the westernworld?W：(13) No, not really, although I've always listened to recordings of great orchestras from Europe.M:So you enjoyed classical music even when you were very young?W:Oh, yes.! was only a child.M:You were born in 1955.Is that right?W:Yes, (14) I began violin lesSons at school when I was 6.M:As young as that.Did you like it?W:Oh, yes.Very much.M:When did you first play on your own?

This is a mystery that many people have carefully thought about.All kinds of myths surround the lives of well-known people.Most people are familiar with the works of William Shakespeare, one of the greatest English writers of the 16th and 17th centuries.(16) Yet how many know Shakespeare the perSon, the man behind the works? After centuries of research, scholars are still trying to discover Shakespeare's perSonal history.It is not easily found in his writings.Authors of the time could not protect their works.An acting company, for example, could change a play if they wanted to.Nowadays, writers have copyrights that protect their work.Many myths arose about Shakespeare.Some said he had no formal education.Others believed that he began his career by tending the horses of wealthy men.All of these myths are interesting, but are they true? Probably not.(17) Shakespeare's father was a respected man in Stratford-on-Avon, a member of the town council.He sent young William to grammar school.Most people of Elizabethan times did not continue beyond grammar school; So, Shakespeare did have, at least, an average education.(18) Some parts of Shakespeare's life will always remain unknown.The Great London Fire of 1666 burned many important documents that could have been a Source of clues.We will always be left with many questions and few facts.预览三道题各选项，选项中都含有he，his或him这些人称代词，再结合选项中多次出现的词汇 works，writers和Sources等可以推测，短文可能与某位男作家相关。16.What does the speaker say about William Shakespeare?D)。短文中作者先提出“有多少人了解莎士比亚本人”的问题，接着指出学者们经过几个世纪的研究之后，仍然在不断探索他的个人史。由此可知，莎士比亚的个人史很少有人知道，故D)为答案。17.What do we learn about Shakespeare’s father?C)。本题考查对莎士比亚父亲的了解，由于使用的人称代词都是he，会对听前预测造成一定的干扰，在听录音时应注意将选项和短文内容进行匹配区别。文章中提到莎士比亚的父亲受人尊敬，是埃文河畔斯特拉特福镇议会的一名成员，故C)为答案。18.Why does the speaker say parts of Shakespeare’s life will remain a mystery?B)。文章中提到1666年伦敦的一场大火把很多重要文件烧毁了，而这些本来可能是了解莎士比亚的线索，因此莎士比亚的一部分生活将永远不为人所知，故B)为答案。Passage TwoWherever you go and for whatever reaSon, it's important to be safe.(19) While the majority of people you will meet when travelling are sure to be friendly and welcoming, there are dangers--theft being the most common.Just as in your home country, do not expect everyone you meet to be friendly and helpful.It's important to prepare for your trip in advance and to take precautions while you are travelling.(20) As you prepare for your trip, make sure you have the right paperwork.You don't want to get to your destination only to find you have the wrong visa, or worse, that your passport isn't valid any more.AlSo, make sure you travel with proper medical insurance, So that if you are sick or injured during your travels, you will be able to get treatment.If you want to drive while you are abroad, make sure you have an international driver's license.(21) When you get to your destination, use official transport.Always go to bus and taxi stands.Don't accept rides from strangers who offer you a lift.If there is no meter in the taxi, agree on a price before you get in.If you prefer to stay in cheap hotels while travelling, make sure you can lock the door of your room from the inside.Finally, remember to smile.It's the friendliest and most sincere form of communication, and is sure to be understood in any part of the world !预览三道题各选项，通过选项中出现的theft，cheating，air crash，road accidents，local customs， reservations，book tickets，docm、aents，agent和transport等词，可以推测这篇短文谈论的是旅游出行的话题。19.What is mentioned as a most common danger when people go travelling abroad?A)。短文开头部分提到，人们在外出旅游时遇到的大部分人都是既友好又热情的，但也会遇到很多危险，而其中最为常见的就是盗窃，故A)为答案。20.What is the most important thing to do when you prepare for your trip abroad?D)。文中提到，在准备出国旅游时，一定要确保文件正确，谁都不想到了目的地却发现签证错误、护照过期等情况。选项D)中的documents与文中的paperwork是同义转述，故D)为答案。21.What does the speaker suggest you do when you arrive at your destination?C)。文章最后给出建议：到达目的地后要选择乘坐正规的交通工具，故C)为答案。Passage Three(25) The British are supposed to be famous for laughing at themselves, but even their sense of humour has a limit, as the British retailer Gerald Ratner found out to his cost.(22) When Ratner took over his father's chain of 130 jewelry shops in 1984, he introduced a very clear company policy.He decided that his shops should sell downmarket products at the lowest possible prices.It was a great success.The British public loved his cheap gold earrings and his tasteless silver ornaments.By 1991, Ratner's company had 2,400 shops and it was worth over 680 million pounds.But in April of that year, Gerald Ratner made a big mistake.(23) At a big meeting of top British businesspeople, he showed up and explained the secret of his success."People say' How can we sell our goods for such a low price?' I say ' Because they are abSolute rubbish.' " His audience roared with laughter.But the British newspapers and the British public were not So amused.(24) People felt insulted and stayed away from Ratner's shops.Sales fell and 6 months after his speech, Ratner's share price had fallen by 42%.The following year, things got worse and Gerald Rather was forced to resign.By the end of 1992, he lost his company, his career and his house.Even worse, 25,000 of his employees had lost their jobs.(25) It had been a very expensive joke.预览四道题各选项，结合选项中的production，products，ornaments，sales promotion， businesspeople，humour和laughs at等词可推断本文和做生意有关系，可能涉及做生意需要的幽默。22.What did Gerald Ratner decide to do when he took over his father’s shops?B)。短文提到，拉特纳在1984年接管了父亲的珠宝连锁店后，决定以最低的价格卖出低档产品，选项B)中sell inexpensive products是原文sell downmarket products的同义转述，故B)为答案。23.On what occasion did Gerald Ratner explain the secret of his success?D)。短文明确提到，在一次英国上层商人会议上，拉特纳出席并解释了自己成功的秘密，故D)为答案。24.How did people feel when they learned of Gerald Ratner’s remarks?A)。短文提到，听到拉特纳的评论后，人们觉得受到了侮辱并远离拉特纳的商店，故A)为答案。25.What does the story of Gerald Ratner suggest?C)。短文开头就点明了主题，提到英国人以自嘲闻名，但即使是对他们来说，幽默也应该有限度，接着短文以拉特纳的故事为例说明这个主题，文末再次强调“这个玩笑的代价太大了”，以此首尾呼应，告诉我们开玩笑要有度，故C)为答案。26.prospering。此处应该填人一个现在分词或形容词，作is的表语。prospering意为“繁荣的”。27.decade。此处应该填入表示时间的名词，与前面的介词during搭配。decade意为“十年”。28.opposite。此处应该填入名词。opposite意为“对立面”。29.sustain。此处应该填入动词原形作从句谓语，上文的先行词reSource uses充当其主语。sustain意为“保持，维持”。30.In simple terms。此处应该填入副词或介词短语作状语。in simple terms意为“简言之”。31.establish。此处应该填入动词原形，与其前面的help搭配，并且能和后面的way搭配。estabfish意为“建立，设立”。32.reaSonably。此处应该填入副词修饰well。reaSonably意为“尚可，还可以”。33.take into account。此处应该填入动词原形或动词短语。take into account意为“考虑，重视”。34.misleading。此处应该填入形容词来修饰sense。misleading意为“令人误解的”。35.using up。此处应该填人动名词或动名词短语来作介词for的宾语，并和forests进行搭配。usingup意为“耗尽，用光”。Part Ⅲ Readina Comorehension美国教育部正在努力确保所有学生享有接受高质量教育的乎等权利：今天，它(36)宣布开始实施“为所有学生提供优秀教育工作者”的活动方案。这一方案将帮助各州和各学区为那些有最迫切需要的学生提供优秀教育工锋者的支持.“所有的孩子.不分种族、居住地及家庭收入，都应(37)有权利接受高质量的教育。为教师和校长们提供帮助学生发挥全部(39)潜力所需的支持是(38)至关重要的，”美国教育部部长阿恩·邓肯说。“尽管我们国家的教师和校长们工作出色且全情(40)投入，全国各地那些极为贫困及少数民族聚集的学校的学生仍然受到不公正的对待：我们必须努力做到更好。地方官员和教育工作者都将(41)形成他们自己的创造性解决方案，但是我们必须共同努力，(42)增强我们对于如何更好地为所有学生招募、支持和(43)留住优秀教师和校长的关注，特别是那些最需要他们的孩子们。”今天的公告是改善获得高质量教育权利的又一重要步骤，是奥巴马总统行动年的一个(44)组成部分。今天晚些时候，邓肯部长将带领召开与来自全国各地的校长和学校教师展开的圆桌会议，讨论有关在高需求的学校工作面临的(45)挑战以及如何采取有前途的举措以支持在这些学校的教育工作者：名词：C)challenges挑战；D)commitment投入，承诺；E)component组成部分，部件；F)contests比赛；L)potential潜力，可能性动词：A)announcing宣布，宣称；H)develop形成，发展；I)distributing分发，散布；J)enhance增强，提高；K)entitled使(某人)有权利；O)retain留用形容词：B)beneficial有利的，有益的；N)qualified胜任的，合格的副词：G)critically很大程度上，极为重要地；M)properly合理地，正确地36.A)announcing。动词辨析题。句首出现时间状语today，空格位于系动词is和名词短语thelaunch of…之间，因此空格处需要填人动词的现在分词形式，构成现在进行时。前一句提到，美国教育部正在努力确保所有学生享有接受高质量教育的平等权利。因此，空格处需要填人一个能够与名词launch构成动宾搭配的动词，表示“宣布开始实施一项方案或活动”。由此确定announcing为本题答案，意思是“宣布”。备选词中，distributing意思是“分发，散布”，与此处文意不符，且无法与launch构成动宾搭配，故排除。37.K)entitled。动词辨析题。空格前面是系动词are，后面是介词to及其宾语，因此空格处需要填入形容词作表语或者动词的被动语态，并与介词to搭配。上文提到，美国教育部今天宣布开始实施为所有学生提供优秀教育工作者的活动方案，本句解释了实施此方案的原因，即所有孩子都应有权利接受高质量的教育。因此，空格处需要填人一个表示“有权利”或“有资格”的形容词，且能够与介词to搭配，备选形容词中只有entitled同时符合这两项要求，由此确定其为本题答案。be entitled to意思是“有……资格”。备选词中，beneficial意思是“有利的，有益的”，与此处文意不符，排除；qualified意思是“有资格的”，但不能与介词to搭配使用，因此也可以排除。38.G)critically。副词辨析题。空格前面是系动词is，后面是形容词important，因此空格处需要填入一个副词，用来修饰形容词important。上句提到，所有的孩子，不分种族、居住地及家庭收入，都应有权利接受高质量的教育，本句承接上句，表明为教师和校长们提供帮助学生发挥全部潜力所需支持的重要性。因此，空格处需要填入一个表示“非常，相当，很”的副词，与important表达“至关重要”的意义，由此确定副词critically为本题答案，意思是“很大程度上，极为重要地”。备选词中，properly意思是“合理地，正确地”，与此处文意不符，因此可以排除。39.L)potential。名词辨析题。空格前面为形容词性物主代词their及形容词hill，因此空格处需要填人一个名词。本句提到要为教师和校长们提供支持，而这些支持是为了帮助学生发挥其全部潜力。因此，空格处需要填入一个能与动词reach相搭配的名词，且表达“潜力，能力”的意义，由此确定名词potential为本题答案，意思是“潜力”。备选词中，challenges意思是“挑战”，commitment意思是“投入，承诺”，component意思是“组成部分，部件”，contests意思是“比赛”，均与此处文意不符，且不能与动词reach搭配，可以排除。40.D)commitment。名词辨析题。空格前面为形容词deep，后面为介词of，因此空格处需要填人名词。根据连词and可以判断，该名词与and前面的excellentwork在意义上应该是并列的，且根据上下文，此处要表达的意义是教师和校长们工作出色且努力。因此，空格处的名词表达的是“努力”或“投入”的意思，且为不可数的抽象名词，备选词中只有commitment一词符合要求，由此确定其为本题答案。备选词中的challenges和contests均为可数名词复数形式，可以排除；component意思是“组成部分，部件”，与此处文意不符，且不能用deep进行修饰，可以排除；potential已经用过，直接排除。41.H)develop。动词辨析题。空格前面为助动词will，后面为名词短语their own creative Solutions，因此空格处需要填入动词原形，与will构成一般将来时态，并与名词Solutions构成动宾短语。Solutions意思是“解决方案”，因此填入的动词应该表达“想出，找到”或“研究出，制定出”的意义。由此可以确定，动词develop为本题答案，意思是“形成”。备选词中，enhance意思是“增强，提高”，retain意思是“留用”，均不能与Solutions搭配，且与此处文意不符，因此可以排除。42.J)enhance。动词辨析题。空格前面是动词短语work together及动词不定式符号to，后面是名词短语our focus，因此空格处需要填入动词原形，且与Our focus构成动宾搭配。根据上下文，教育部长认为我们必须共同努力增强对于某些问题的关注。因此，空格处填人的动词应该表达“增强，增加”的意义，由此可以确定，动词enhance为本题答案，意思是“增强，提高”。备选词中，develop已经用过，直接排除；retain意思是“留用”，与此处文意不符，也可以排除。43.O)retain。动词辨析题。根据and前面的两个动词recruit和support及其形式可以判断，空格处需要填入的是动词原形，且与recruit和support构成并列关系，recruit意思是“招募”，support意思是“支持，配备”，宾语都是空格后的effective teachers and principals，由此可以确定，动词retain为本题答案。44.E)component。名词辨析题。空格前面是不定冠词a，后面是介词of，因此空格处需要填入可数名词的单数形式。前面讲到，今天的公告是改善获得高质量教育权利的又一重要步骤，而介词of后面又提到了奥巴马总统行动年，因此可以判断今天的公告内容是奥巴马总统行动年的行动内容之一，空格处应填入表示“内容，组成部分”的名词。由此可以确定名词component为本题答案，意思是“组成部分”。备选词中，commitment和potential已经用过，直接排除；challenges和contests均为可数名词的复数形式，也可以排除。45.C)challenges。名词辨析题。空格前面是定冠词the，后面是介词of，因此空格处应填入名词形式。本句介绍的是邓肯部长将带领召开与来自全国各地的校长和学校教师展开的圆桌会议内容，根据上下文，在高需求的学校工作必将面临更多的挑战或困难。因此，空格处填入的名词可能表达“困难，问题”或“挑战”的意义，由此可以判断，名词challenges为本题答案，意思是“挑战”。备选词中，commitment，potential和component均用过，直接排除；contests意思是“比赛”，与此处文意不符，也可以排除。快餐业面临的改变A)快餐业不得不成为一个厚着脸皮生存的群体。健康专家因其向人们兜售令人肥胖的食品而不断对其进行猛烈抨击。评论家们甚至抱怨说商标代表超高热量的麦当劳不应该获准赞助世界杯。(47)这些是快餐业已经学会去处理的一些事情。但是，可能撑不了多久。当汉堡企业准备采取策略来对全球经济的变化做出回应时,还面临着来自监管部门更多的压力。B)快餐曾经被认为可以抵抗经济衰退。(50)逻辑上，当消费者要削减开支时，巨无霸和皇堡等便宜的食物会变得更有吸引力。在最近的经济衰退中，当快餐商家留住了那些在休闲餐馆也付不起钱的消费者时，这样的“降级消费”得以证明。在美国，这个快餐的发源地，伴随着快餐业的打折活动以及促销活动，例如推出l美元菜单和便宜的什锦饭，快餐店客流也变得兴旺起来。C)结果，快餐连锁企业比那些贵一点的同行们更好地度过了这次经济危机。在2009年美国提供全方位服务的餐馆的营业额与以前同期相比有超过6％的降幅，但是快餐连锁企业的营业额却依然保持不变。其他国家的市场，如日本、法国和英国，在快餐上的整体消费呈增长态势。在美国同行业的营业额中，世界上最大的快餐企业麦当劳在没有下滑的情况下度过了经济衰退期。以其新鲜原料闻名的美国快餐连锁店帕尼罗面包同样表现良好，因为它以比饭店低廉的价格提供了更高质量的食品。D)但并非所有的快餐企业都如此幸运。诸如汉堡王等许多企业的营业额就有所下滑。(51)在经济衰退的严峻时期，尽管一些人降级消费转向快餐，但许多人为了省钱而更频繁地在家里吃饭。瑞士联合银行的分析师大卫·帕尔曼表示，在美国，一些小型的快餐连锁店，如玩偶匣和卡乐星，在这次经济衰退中受到了特别严重的冲击，因为它们要与麦当劳这样的全球性快餐巨头进行竞争。去年，在其他企业都减少广告投入的情况下，麦当劳在广告宣传土的投入却增加了7％多。E)一些快餐企业还不惜牺牲自己的利润试图给顾客们更好的优惠。(52)在经济衰退期间，很多商家采取低价策略，他们期望一旦吸引顾客进门，就能够劝说他们购买稍贵的产品。但在多数情况下，这种策略并不奏效。去年，汉堡王的特许经销商就因为双层奶酪汉堡的促销活动而起诉该公司，声称以l美元出售这些成本价为1.10美元的产品对他们来说是不公平的。五月份法官裁决表示支持汉堡王。尽管如此，这家公司可能还是要咒骂其做出的促销便宜菜品而不是更高价菜品的决定，因为这些“实惠菜单”上的菜品在销售总额中所占的比例从去年lo月的l2％上升到了现在的20％。F)(54)分析人士对今年快餐业的适度增长有所期待。但是衰退的形势促使商家重新考虑他们的策略。现在许多商家推出一些价格稍高的商品试图将消费者从1美元的特价商品中吸引回来。拥有塔可钟和必胜客的百胜餐饮集团的旗下品牌肯德基已经推出了一款售价约5美元的鸡肉三明治。五月份汉堡王推出了7美元八个的烤猪排。G)许多快餐企业也试图让消费者购买包括饮料在内的更多新产品。麦当劳开始销售更优质的咖啡作为对星巴克的挑战。它的“麦克咖啡”系列在美国本土的销售量约占6％。(48)星巴克已经将它的西雅图最好咖啡的品牌版权出售给了汉堡王，该咖啡将在今年晚些时候开始销售。H)因为销售策略从“大尺寸”向“更多买家”转变，快餐商家需要维持一天的高客流量。(53)许多商家看到了早餐市场的巨大商机，而不是仅仅出售高脂肪的食物。麦当劳明年将在美国销售粥类食物。伯恩斯坦调查公司的分析师莎拉·塞纳托尔表示，早餐市场具有很好的赚钱潜力，因为其利润相当高。快餐商家也在增加中午和夜晚小吃的种类，例如混合型饮料及包装食品。其想法是，通过在菜单上涵盖更广的范围，“我们可以卖给消费者他们一整天都需要的食物，”百胜集团首席财务官瑞克·卡如茨说道。I)但是那些越长越粗的腰围怎么办呢?到目前为止，快餐企业已经聪明地避开了政府的监管。(49)通过提供一些健康的选择，像沙拉和低热量的三明治，这些企业至少给人们留下了采取行动帮助对抗肥胖的印象。提供的这些东西未必是亏本特卖品，因为它们增强了廉价食品店对食客群体，包括不想吃汉堡的人们的吸引力。但是消费者不能被强制点沙拉来代替薯条。J)在未来，简单提供一些健康的可供选择的食品可能是不够的。“每一个我所了解的包装食品和餐馆企业现在都在关心法律规定，”瑞银集团的帕尔曼先生表示。(55)今年美国国会通过的健康改革法案要求拥有20家及以上连锁店的餐馆将它们所供应的食品卡路里含量印制在菜单上。一项由美国国家经济研究局开展的对2007年在纽约推出的相似热量张贴法案对星巴克的影响跟踪调查发现，在旁边有唐恩都乐连锁店的情况下，星巴克每次交易中的平均热量值减少了6％，而收益增长了3％——也就是说，这些菜单标签有助于这些连锁企业提供更健康的菜品。K)为了避免与美国和其他地方的法规起冲突，快餐企业将不得不继续创新。麦当劳的沃特·瑞克宣称其公司已经对菜单进行了改良，这意味着麦当劳与几年前相比会提供更多健康的食品。“与世界上的其他餐饮企业相比，我们可能会销售更多的蔬菜、更多的牛奶、更多的沙拉以及更多的苹果，”他说道。(46)但是加利福尼亚州的一个小镇最近提出一项议案，即禁止麦当劳在其高热量的“快乐套餐”中附赠玩具，因为立法者们认为这会引诱孩子们去吃不健康的食物，这表明还有更多事情等着快餐企业去做。46.Some people propose laws be madeto stop McDonald's from attaching toys to its food specials for children.有些人提议立法来禁止麦当劳将玩具附赠到为孩子提供的特价食品上。由题干中的propose laws和toys定位到文章K)段画线处。K) In order to avoid other legislation in America and elsewhere,fast-food companies will have to continue innovating (创新).Walt Riker of McDonald's claims the change it has made in its menu means it offers more healthy items than it did a few years ago."We probably sell more vegetables, more milk, more salads, more apples than any restaurant business in the world," he says.But the recent proposal by a county in California to ban McDonald's from including toys in its high-calorie " Happy Meals ", because legislators believe it attracts children to unhealthy food, suggests there is a lot more left to do.47.Fast-food firms may not be able tocopewithpressuresfromfoodregulation in the near future.快餐企业在不久的将来可能不能处理来自食品法规的压力。由题干中的cope with，pressures和food regulation定位到文章A)段画线处。A)Fast-food firms have to be a thick-skinned bunch.Healthexperts regularly criticise them severely for selling food thatmakes people fat.Critics even complain that McDonald's,whose logo symbolises calorie excess, should not have beenallowed to sponSor the World Cup.These are things fast-foodfirms have learnt to cope with.But not perhaps for muchlonger.The burger business faces more pressure fromregulators at a time when it is already adapting strategies inresponse to shifts in the global economy.48.Burger King will start to sell Seattle's Bestcoffee to increase sales.汉堡王将开始出售西雅图最好咖啡来提高销售额。由题干中的Burger rang和Seattle’sBest coffee定位到文章G)段画线处。G) Companies are alSo trying to get customers to buynew and more items, including drinks.McDonald'sstarted selling better coffee as a challenge toStarbucks.Its "McCafe" line now accounts for anestimated 6% of sales in America.Starbucks has Soldrights to its Seattle's Best coffee brand to BurgerKing, which will start selling it later this year.49.Some fast-food firms provide healthyfood to give the impression they arehelping to tackle the obesity problem.一些快餐企业提供健康食品以给人留下他们在帮助解决肥胖问题的印象。由题干中的healthy food，give the impression和obesity定位到文章I)段画线处。I) But what about those growing waistlines? So far, fast-foodfirms havecleverly avoided government regulation.By providing healthy options, like salads and low-caloriesandwiches, they have at least given the impression ofdoing Something about helping to fight obesity (肥胖症).These offerings are not necessarily loss-leaders, as theybroaden the appeal of outlets to groups of diners that includeSome people who don't want to eat a burger.But customerscannot be forced to order salads instead of fries.50.During therecession,manycustomers turned to fast food tosave money.在经济衰退期，很多顾客为了省钱都转向快餐。由题干中的recession，customers和fast food定位到文章B)段画线处。B)Fast food was once thought to be recession-proof.When consumers need to cut spending, the logic goes, cheap mealslike Big Macs and Whoppers become even more attractive.Such"trading down" proved true for much of the latest recession,when fast-food companies picked up customers who could no longer afford to eat at casual restaurants.Traffic was boosted inAmerica, the home of fast food, with discounts and promotions,such as $1 menus and cheap combination meals.51.Many people eat out less often tosave money in times of recession.在经济衰退时期，很多人为了省钱而减少在外吃饭的次数。由题于中的eat out，save money和recession定位到文章D)段西线处。D) But not all fast-food companies have been as fortunate.Many,such as Burger King, have seen sales fall.In a severe recession,while Some people trade down to fast food, many others eat athome more frequently to save money.David Palmer, an analystat UBS, a bank, says smaller fast-food chains in America, suchas Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr., have been hit particularly hardin this downturn because they are competing with the global giantMcDonald's, which increased spending on advertising by morethan 7% last year as others cut back.52.During the recession, BurgerKing's promotional strategy ofofferinglow-priceditemSoften proved ineffective.在经济衰退时期，汉堡王提供低价食品的促销策略常常被证明是没有效果的。由题干中的Burger King，strategy和low-priced items定位到文章E)段画线处。E)Some fast-food companies alSo sacrificed their own profits by tryingto give customers better value.During the recession companies setprices low, hoping that once they had tempted customers throughthe door they would be persuaded to order more expensive items.But in many cases that strategy did not work.Last year BurgerKing franchisees (特许经营人) sued (起诉) the company over itsdouble-cheeseburger promotion, claiming it was unfair for them tobe required to sell these for $1 when they cost $1.10 to make.In May a judge ruled in favour of Burger King.Nevertheless, thecompany may still be cursing its decision to promote cheap choiceSover more expensive ones because items on its "value menu" nowaccount for around 20% of all sales, up from 12% last October.53.Fast-foodrestaurantscanmakealotofmoney by sellingbreakfast.通过卖早餐，快餐店能够赚很多钱。由题干中的selling breakfast定位到文章H)段画线处。H) As fast-food companies shift from "super size" to "more buys", they needto keep customer traffic high throughout the day.Many see breakfast as abig opportunity, and not just for fatty food.McDonald's will start sellingporridge (粥) in America next year.Breakfast has the potential to bevery profitable, says Sara Senatore of Berustein, a research firm, becausethe margins can be high.Fast-food companies are alSo adding midday andlate-night snacks, such as blended drinks and wraps.The idea is that by having a greater range of things on the menu, "we can sell to consumers products they want all day, "says Rick Carucci, the chief financial officer of Yum ! Brands.54.Manyfast-foodcompaniesnowexpect to increase their revenue byintroducing higher-priced items.很多快餐企业现在期望通过推出高价产品来增加收益。由题干中的introducing higher-priced items定位到文章F)段画线处。F) Analysts expect the fast-food industry to grow modestly thisyear.But the downturn is malting companies rethink theirstrategies.Many are now introducing higher-priced itemsto entice (引诱) consumers away from $1 specials.KFC, adivision of Yum! Brands, which alSo owns Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, has launched a chicken sandwich that costsaround $ 5.And in May Burger King introduced barbecue (烧烤) pork ribs at $ 7 for eight.55.A newly-passed law asks bigfast-food chains to specify thecalorie count of what theyserve on the menu.一项新通过的法律要求大型快餐连锁企业在菜单上详细标明它们供应的食品卡路里含量。由题干中的a newlypassed law，specify the calorie count和menu定位到文章J)段画线处。J) In the future, simply offering a healthy option may not be goodenough."Every packaged-food and restaurant company I know isconcerned about regulation right now," says Mr.Palmer of UBS.America's health-reform bill, which Congress passed thisyear, requires restaurant chains with 20 or more outlets to put thecalorie-content of items they serve on the menu.A study by theNational Bureau of Economic Research, which tracked the effectSon Starbucks of a similar calorie-posting law in New York City in2007, found that the average calorie-count per transaction fell 6%and revenue increased 3% at Starbucks stores where a DunkinDonuts outlet was nearby--a sign, it is said, that menu-labellingcould favour chains that have more healthy offerings.Passage One(56)如果你认为高指数的防晒霜能够使你免遭有害射线的辐射，那你可能就错了。(57)本周《自然》杂查的一项研究表明，尽管防晒指数为50的防晒霜能够减少黑瘤的数量，并延缓其出现，但却并不能阻止其发生。黑瘤是最具侵犯性的皮肤癌。如果你拥有红发或金发、浅色皮肤、蓝色或绿色眼睛，或者容易晒伤，又或者有近亲患此疾病，那么你将有相对较高的患病风险。如果你周期性地暴露于强烈的阳光下，黑瘤则更为常见。长期暴露于阳光下.其他皮肤癌也越来越有可能发生。对于防晒霜减少黑瘤的有效性一直存在争议——比起对于预防其他类型的皮肤癌，其证据更加乏力。(58)2011年澳大利亚一项涉及l，621人的研究发现，随机抽取的每天使用防晒霜的人群患黑瘤的几率是需要时才使用面霜的人群的一半。第二项研究则将l，167名患有黑瘤的人和l，101名未患这种癌症的人进行对比，发现日常使用防晒霜，并且同时使用帽子、长袖衫、躲在阴凉地方等其他防护措施的人，的确对这种疾病具有某些防护性。这项研究指出，其他形式的防晒措施——不是防晒霜——似乎最为有益。(59)此研究基于人们对他们一生中每个十年所采取防晒措施的记忆，因此并不完全可靠。但是认为防晒霜给人们错误防晒意识似乎又是合理的。许多人使用防晒霜的方法也并不正确——用量不足、几小时后未能重新涂抹以及过长时间暴露于阳光下。晒伤才是最令人担忧的问题——最近的一项研究显示，青少年时期五次晒伤的经历就足以增加所有皮肤癌的患病风险。(60)好消息是，正如澳大利亚人“套上-涂上-扣上”运动的数据所显示的，综合使用防晒霜和皮肤遮盖措施能够降低黑瘤发病率。因此，如果今年夏天有热浪，我们也最好套上T恤，抹上防晒霜，并且扣上帽子。56.B)。由题干中的high—factor sunscreen定位到首段第一句：If you think a high—factor sunscreen(防晒霜)keeps you safe from harmful rays，you may be wrong.推理判断题。文章开篇即指出，如果你认为高指数的防晒霜能够使你免遭有害射线的辐射，那你可能就错了。由此可见，对于防晒霜能够保护皮肤不受伤害的这种误解是非常普遍的，因此，人们对于高指数防晒霜的普遍预期是它将保护人们不被太阳晒伤.故答案为B)。A)“它将延缓皮肤癌的发生”，本段第二句指出，一项研究表明，尽管防晒指数为50的防晒霜能够减少黑瘤的数量，并延缓其出现，但却并不能阻止其发生，因此排除；C)“它将保持他们的皮肤光滑白皙”，文章并未提及，排除；D)“它对于任何肤色的人都会起作用”，本段第四句提到了浅色皮肤的人更容易被晒伤，但是文章并未涉及防晒霜对于各种肤色人群的作用，因此排除。57.A)。由题干中的research in Nature定位到首段第二句：Research in this week’s Nature showsthat while factor 50 reduces the number of melanomas(黑瘤)and delays their occurrence.it can't prevent them.事实细节题。文章首段第二句提到，本周《自然》杂志的一项研究表明，尽管防晒指数为50的防晒霜能够减少黑瘤的数量，并延缓其出现，但却并不能阻止其发生。由此可见，此项研究表明高指数的防晒霜并不能有效阻止黑瘤的发生，故答案为A)。B)“它在强烈光照的情况下是无效的”，定位句并未提及光照强度与防晒霜效果之间的关系，因此排除；C)“它对于长时间暴露于阳光下无效”，本段第五句提到，如果你周期性地暴露于强烈的阳光下，黑瘤则更为常见，但并未涉及防晒霜效果问题，因此排除；D)“它对于浅色皮肤的人无效”，本段第四句提到，如果拥有红发或金发、浅色皮肤、蓝色或绿色眼睛，或者容易晒伤，又或者有近亲患此疾病，将有相对较高的患黑瘤这种癌症的风险，这里提到了浅色皮肤的人属于黑瘤高发人群，也未将其与防晒霜的作用相联系，因此也排除。58.D)。由题干中的the 2011 Australian study of l，621 people定位到第二段第二句：A 2011 Australian study of 1,621 people found that people randomly selected to apply sunscreen daily had half the rate of melanomas of people who used cream as needed.推理判断题。文章第二段首句指出，对于防晒霜减少黑瘤的有效性一直存在争议，第二句则举例说明，提到2011年澳大利亚一项涉及1，621人的研究发现，随机抽取的每天使用防晒霜的人群患黑瘤的几率是需要时才使用面霜的人群的一半。由此可知，根据此项研究，每天使用防晒霜的确能够降低患黑瘤的几率，即坚持使用防晒霜是有一定效果的，故答案为D)。A)“防晒霜应该与其他防护措施同时使用”，本题的题干是我们能够从2011年澳大利亚一项涉及l，621人的研究中获知什么，而此选项内容是下文提到的第二项研究的发现，不符合题意，因此排除；B)“高危人群从防晒霜的使用中获益最多”，此项研究并未涉及防晒霜对于高危人群的作用，排除； C)“防晒霜的无规律使用对女性来说弊大于利”，文章并未提及.因此排除。59.C)。由题干中的the second Australian study定位到第二段第五句：The study relied on peopleremembering what they had done over each decade of their lives, So it's not entirelv reliable,推理判断题。该段第三、四句承接上文，介绍了澳大利亚的第二项相关研究，第五句则是作者对研究过程与结果的主观评论，指出，由于此研究基于人们对他们一生中每个十年所采取防晒措施的回忆，因此并不完全可靠。由此可见，此研究并不是基于对被研究对象的直接观察，故答案为C)。A)“它误导人们依靠防晒霜作为防护”，根据该段第三、四句，此项研究发现，日常使用防晒霜，并且同时使用帽子、长袖衫、躲在阴凉地方等其他防护措施的人，的确对这种疾病具有某些防护性，还指出，其他形式的防晒措施——不是防晒霜——似乎最为有益，可见，这并不会对使用防晒霜的人们造成误导，因此排除；B)“它帮助人们选择最有效的防晒霜”，此项研究并未提及防晒霜的选择问题，因此排除；D)“它证实了澳大利亚第一项研究的结果”，根据该段第二句，第一项研究发现了防晒霜的有效性，而第三、四句则指出第二项研究的结论是防晒霜需要与其他防晒措施共同使用，且其他防晒措施可能更为有效.可见第二项研究并非证实第一项研究的结果，因此排除。60.A)。由题干中的reduce melanoma rates定位到第四段：The good news is that a combination of sunscreen and covering up can reduce melanoma rates, as shown by Australian figures from their slip-slop-slap campaign.So if there is a heat wave this summer, it would be best for us, too, to slip on a shirt, slop on (抹上) sunscreen and slap on a hat.推理判断题。文章第四段第一句提到，正如澳大利亚人“套上一涂上一扣上”运动的数据所显示的，综合使用防晒霜和皮肤遮盖措施能够降低黑瘤发病率，第二句据此提出作者自己的观点和建议：如果今年夏天有热浪，我们也最好套上T恤，抹上防晒霜，并且扣上帽子。也就是说，作者建议我们同时使用防晒霜和衣服、帽子等其他防护措施，故答案为A)。B)“尽可能躲在阴凉的地方”，文章第二段提及的第二项研究提到了躲在阴凉地方这种防护措施，但是作者并未对此进行评论和推荐，因此排除；C)“使用遮挡的防护措施代替防晒霜”，根据文章第四段，作者推荐综合使用各种防护措施，并未建议放弃使用防晒霜，因此排除；D)“使用适量的防晒霜”，文章第三段介绍了许多人对防晒霜的错误使用方法，其中之一是用量不足，但这并非作者的建议内容，因此排除。Passage Two(61)在发达国家，与技术水平较低的人相比，受教育程度较高的人工作年限越来越长。年龄在62岁到74岁的美国人中，拥有专业学位的人约有65％仍然处在劳动大军之中，而只拥有高中学历的人只有32％尚在工作。(62)这一差距正是不断加剧的高学历高收入富人与无技术低收入穷人之间两极分化的部分表现。迅速发展堕技术使高技术人群的收入增加，同时也压缩了无技术人群的收入。无论对于个人还是社会，其影响都颇为深远。世界正在面临老龄人口数量惊人的增长，而他们将比以往任何时候都更长寿。在接下来的20年里，全球65岁及以上的人口数量将几乎翻一番，从6亿增加至ll亿。(63)20世纪，更加长寿造成了退休生活的年份更长而不是工作的年份更长，这一经历使得观察家们相信，这一变化将导致经济增长减缓，同时，退休金申领人数的激增将产生政府预算问题。但是，工作中的年轻人与清闲的老年人之间出现严重分化的这一概念忽略了一个新的趋势，即不断增大的高技术人群与无技术人群之间的差距。年轻的无技术人群的就业率下降，而老龄的高技术人群工作年份却越来越长。这一分化在美国表现得最为严重，二战后生育高峰期出生的高学历美国人正一再推迟退休，而很多技术较低的年轻人却被挤出劳动力市场。政策是一方面的原因。(64)许多欧洲国家政府已经摒弃了曾鼓励人们尽早退休的政策。预期寿命的延长以及慷慨的固定养老金计划被不再慷慨的固定缴费养老金计划所替代，这些都意味着甚至有钱人也必须延长工作年限以获得舒适的退休生活。但是，工作性质的变化也起到了很大作用。对那些高学历人士而言，工作报酬在大幅增加，这些人将继续获得较高的收入，直到老年，因为当今的老龄高学历人群比上一代人工作更有成效。(65)技术革新可能将进一步增强这一转变：作为计算机的补充的技能，从经营管理技巧到创新能力，都不会随着年龄的增长而衰退。61.B)。由题干中的rich countries定位到首段第一句：Across the rich world，well educated people increasinglv work longer than the less.skilled.事实细节题。文章开篇即指出，在发达国家，与技术水平较低的人相比，受教育程度较高的人工作年限越来越长。由此可见，目前在发达国家的劳动力大军中，学历较高的人工作时间更长，故答案为B)。A)“年轻人正在取代老年人”，根据本段第二句的介绍，年龄在62岁到74岁的美国人中，拥有专业学位的人约有65％仍然处在劳动大军之中，可见年轻人并未取代老年人，因此排除；C)“失业率正在逐年递增”和D)“没有大学学位的人找工作很困难”，文章并未提及，因此排除。62.B)。由题干中的deepen the divide定位到首段第三、四句：This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-educated well-off and the unskiUed poor.Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skiUed while Soueezing those of the unslkilled.事实细节题。文章首段第三句承接上文指出，这一差距正是不断加剧的高学历高收入富人与无技术低收入穷人之间两极分化的部分表现。第四句进一步分析了原因，即迅速发展的技术使高技术人群的收入增加，同时也压缩了那些无技术人群的收入。由此可见，迅速发展的技术就是加剧贫富差距的主要原因，故答案为B)。A)“更长的预期寿命”，本段内容中并未提及预期寿命的相关内容，因此排除；C)“劳动人口的深层次变化”，本段并未涉及劳动力结构的深层次变化问题，因此排除；D)“高学历人才数量的增加”，本段第二句提到，年龄在62岁到74岁的美国人中，拥有专业学位的人约有65％仍然处在劳动大军之中，但并未指出高学历人才的数量较之前有所增加，因此也排除。63.A)。由题干中的the experience of the 20th century定位到第二段第三句：The expenence of the 20th century, when greater longevity (长寿) translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems.事实细节题。文章第二段第三句指出，20世纪，更加长寿造成了退休生活的年份更长而不是工作的年份更长，这一经历使得观察家们相信，这一变化将导致经济增长减缓，同时，退休金申领人数的激增将产生政府预算问题。由此可知，根据20世纪的经历，观察家们预测到的问题之一是经济增长将减缓，故答案为A)。B)“政府预算将增加”，根据本段第三句内容，观察家们预测到两个问题，一是经济增长减缓，二是政府预算问题，并未说明预算会增加，因此排除；C)“更多人将努力接受高等教育”，文章中并未提及观察家们对人们态度变化的预测，因此排除；D)“就业市场竞争将更加激烈”，文章中并未指出观察家们对就业市场变化的预测，因此也排除。64.C)。由题干中的policy changes in European countries定位到第四段的第二、三句：Many European governments have abandoned policies that used to encourage people to retire early.Rising life expectancy (预期寿命), combined with the replacement of generous defmed-benefit pension plans with less generous defined-contribution ones, means that even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement.事实细节题。文章第四段第二句和第三句提到，许多欧洲国家政府已经摒弃了曾鼓励人们尽早退休的政策。预期寿命的延长以及慷慨的固定养老金计划被不再慷慨的固定缴费养老金计划所替代，这些都意味着甚至有钱人也必须延长工作年限以获得舒适的退休生活。由此可知，政策的变化带来的后果是甚至有钱人也不得不为了在退休后过上舒适的生活而延长工作年限，故答案为C)。A)“无技术的人可能选择尽早退休”，根据文章第四段第二句，许多欧洲国家政府已经摒弃了曾鼓励人们尽早退休的政策，可见，人们可能都会因此而延长工作时间，因此排除；B)“更多的人不得不接受在职培训”，文章中并未提及职业培训问题，因此排除；D)“人们可能会从养老金计划中获得慷慨的固定福利”，根据第四段第三句，慷慨的固定养老金计划被不再慷慨的固定缴费养老金计划所替代，可见养老金计划已经修改，早已不再像从前那样慷慨，因此排除。65.D)。由题干中的characteristic of work定位到第四段第四至六句：But the changing nature of work alSo plays a big role.Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation.Technological change may well reinforce that shift:the skills that complement computers, from management knowhow to creativity, do not necessarily decline with age.推理判断题。文章第四段第四句提到，工作性质的变化也起到了很大作用，第五句进而对工作性质的变化进行了分析，指出对那些高学历人士而言，工作报酬在大幅增加，这些人将继续获得较高的收入，直到老年，因为当今的老龄高学历人群比上一代人工作更有成效，第六句对上文进行了总结，得出结论，技术革新可能将进一步增强这一转变：作为计算机的补充的技能，从经营管理技巧到创新能力，都不会随着年龄的增长而衰退。由此可见，21世纪的工作特点是，比起年龄问题，经营管理技巧、创新能力等技能将更加被看重，故答案为D)。A)“计算机将承担更复杂的工作”，文章第四段的末句提到从经营管理技巧到创新能力，都是作为计算机的补充的技能，因此更复杂的工作仍然是由人来承担的，而非计算机，故排除；B)“史多的工作将由年轻的高学历人才承担”，根据文章第四段的内容，作者强调的是老龄高学历人群比上一代人工作更有成效，因此相对于年轻人，年龄较长的高学历人才将更受欢迎，故排除；C)“大多数工作将是创造性的”，文章末句提到创新能力可以作为计算机的补充，可见，除了创新性工作之外，仍有大量的其他工作需要计算机完成，因此也排除。Part Ⅳ TranslationChina is one of the most ancient civilizations across the world, from which many elements that construct the foundation of the modem world are derived.Now China has the world's fastest growing economy and is experiencing a new industrial revolution.It has alSo launched an ambitious space exploration plan, including the building of a space station by 2020.Currently, being one of the largest exporters in the world, China is attracting massive foreign investment.Meanwhile, it has invested billions of dollars overseas as well.In 2011, China surpassed Japan, becoming the second largest economic entity in the world.1.翻译第一句时需要注意，“……之一”的表述中，名词使用复数形式，“最古老的文明之一”刚译为one of themost ancient civilizations或one of the oldest civilizations。2.翻译第二句时，需要注意句子的主干为“元素起源于中国”，谓语动词“起源于”可译为be derived from或originate from；定语“构成现代世界基础的”较长，可处理为定语从旬来修饰先行词“元素”；“构成……基础”可译为cons.Ia-uct the foundation of或form the basis of。由于第一句和第二句均为简单句，都出现了“中国”一词，翻译时既可以单独成句，也可以合二为一。本译文采用后者，将第一句作为主句，第二句处理为定语从句，用介词+which来引导，修饰第一句中的China，从而使译文更加简洁连贯。3.翻译第三句时，需要注意该句主语为“中国”，旬中有两个并列谓语“拥有”和“经历”。“拥有”表示的是客观事实，可采用一般现在时，“正经历着”强调当前的情况，可采用现在进行时；“工业革命”可译为industrialrevolution。4.第四句中“太空探索计划”可直译为space exploration plan，也可意译为plan for exploring the outer space；“启动”可译为launch或start。5.第五句和第三句结构相似，该句有两种译法。可以翻译为两个并列的简单句，也可以将“中国正在吸引大量外国投资’’译为主句，时态为现在进行时；“是世界最大的出口国之一”采用非谓语结构，译为being one of thelargest exporters in the world，避免单调和重复。6.第六句为简单句，“在海外投资”译为invest overseas，“数十亿”译为billions of。7.翻译最后一句时应注意时态。该句表述的是过去的事实，应使用一般过去时。“超越”译为surpass；“成为”这个短语有两种译法，可以将“超越”和“成为”处理为两个并列的动作，译为became the second largesteconomy in the world：也可以将“成为”处理为现在分词作状语，表示结果，译为becoming the second largesteconomic entity in the world。Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the

You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.An office tower on Miller Street in Manchester is completely covered in solar panels. They are used to create some of the energy used by the insurance company inside. When the tower was first 26 in 1962, it was covered with thin square stones. These small square stones became a problem for the building and continued to fall off the face for 40 years until a major renovation was 27 . During this renovation the building s owners, CIS, 28 the solar panel company, Solarcentury. They agreed to cover the entire building in solar panels. In 2004, the completed CIS tower became Europe s largest 29 of vertical solar panels. A vertical solar project on such a large 30 has never been repeated since.
Covering a skyscraper with solar panels had never been done before, and the CIS tower was chosen as one of the "10 best green energy projects". For a long time after this renovation project, it was the tallest building in the United Kingdom, but it was 31 overtaken by the Millbank Tower.
Green buildings like this aren t 32 cost-efficient for the investor, but it does produce much less pollution than that caused by energy 33 through fossil fuels. As solar panels get 34 , the world is likely to see more skyscrapers covered in solar panels, collecting energy much like trees do. Imagine a world where building the tallest skyscraper wasn t a race of 35 , but rather one to collect the most solar energy.

Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.Some College Students Are Angry That They Have to Pay to Do Their HomeworkA) Digital learning systems now charge students for access codes needed to complete coursework, take quizzes, and turn in homework. As universities go digital, students are complaining of a new hit to their finances that s replacing—and sometimes joining—expensive textbooks: pricey online access codes that are required to complete coursework and submit assignments.
B) The codes—which typically range in price from $ 80 to $ 155 per course—give students online access to systems developed by education companies like McGraw Hill and Pearson. These companies, which long reaped big profits as textbook publishers, have boasted that their new online offerings, when pushed to students through universities they partner with, represent the future of the industry.
C) But critics say the digital access codes represent the same profit-seeking ethos (观念) of the textbook business, and are even harder for students to opt out of. While they could once buy second-hand textbooks, or share copies with friends, the digital systems are essentially impossible to avoid.
D) "When we talk about the access code we see it as the new face of the textbook monopoly (垄断), a new way to lock students around this system," said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, to BuzzFeed News. "Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you re paying $ 120," said Senack. "But because it s all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out."
E) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015—pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120—a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.
F) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. "It s a balancing act," she said. "Can I really afford these access codes now?" She didn t hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.
G) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they re the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 "was derived from digital products."
H) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that "digital materials are less expensive and a good investment" that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn t respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that "in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over."
I) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. "These digital products aren t just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features," David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. "It helps students understand in a way that you can t do with print homework assignments."
J) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn t require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. "I try to make things as inexpensive as possible," said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. "The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I m giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most."
K) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn t require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. "That s two months of rent," she said. "You can t sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester s books. With an access code, you re out of that money. "
L) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that "it s ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework." Many of the access codes he s purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. "Often it s only 10% of your grade in class." he said. "You re paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade—but if you didn t have it, it would affect your grades enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C." Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.
M) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can t be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.
N) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. "We don t really have a missed assignment policy," she said. "If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it s not fun."
36. A student s yearly expenses on access codes may amount to their rent for two months.
37. The online access codes may be seen as a way to tie the students to the digital system.
38. If a student takes a course again, they may have to buy a new access code to submit their assignments.
39. McGraw Hill accounts for over one-fifth of the market share of college textbooks.
40. Many traditional textbook publishers are now offering online digital products, which they believe will be the future of the publishing business.
41. One student complained that they now had to pay for access codes in addition to the high tuition.
42. Digital materials can cost students less than half the price of traditional printed books according to a publisher.
43. One student decided not to buy her access code until she received the pay for her part-time job.
44. Online systems may deprive teachers of opportunities to make the best use of their expertise for their students.
45. Digital access codes are criticized because they are profit-driven just like the textbook business.Section CDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.Losing your ability to think and remember is pretty scary. We know the risk of dementia (痴呆症) increases with age. But if you have memory slips, you probably needn t worry. There are pretty clear differences between signs of dementia and age-related memory loss.
After age 50, it s quite common to have trouble remembering the names of people, places and things quickly, says Dr. Kirk Daffner of Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston.
The brain ages just like the rest of the body. Certain parts shrink, especially areas in the brain that are important to learning, memory and planning. Changes in brain cells can affect communication between different regions of the brain. And blood flow can be reduced as blood vessels narrow.
Forgetting the name of an actor in a favorite movie, for example, is nothing to worry about. But if you forget the plot of the movie or don t remember even seeing it, that s far more concerning, Daffner says.
When you forget entire experiences, he says, that s "a red flag that something more serious may be involved." Forgetting how to operate a familiar object like a microwave oven, or forgetting how to drive to the house of a friend you ve visited many times before can also be signs of something going wrong.
But even then, Daffner says, people shouldn t panic. There are many things that can cause confusion and memory loss, including health problems like temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, high blood pressure, or depression, as well as medications (药物) like antidepressants.
You don t have to figure this out on your own. Daffner suggests going to your doctor to check on medications, health problems and other issues that could be affecting memory. And the best defense against memory loss is to try to prevent it by building up your brain s cognitive (认知的) reserve, Daffner says.
"Read books, go to movies, take on new hobbies or activities that force one to think in novel ways," he says. In other words, keep your brain busy and working. And also get physically active, because exercise is a known brain booster.
46. Why does the author say that one needn t be concerned about memory slips?
A) Not all of them are symptoms of dementia.
B) They occur only among certain groups of people.
C) Not all of them are related to one s age.
D) They are quite common among fifty-year-olds.
47. What happens as we become aged according to the passage?
A) Our interaction skills deteriorate.
B) Some parts of our brain stop functioning.
C) Communication within our brain weakens.
D) Our whole brain starts shrinking.
48. Which memory-related symptom should people take seriously?
A) Totally forgetting how to do one s daily routines.
B) Inability to recall details of one s life experiences.
C) Failure to remember the names of movies or actors.
D) Occasionally confusing the addresses of one s friends.
49. What should people do when signs of serious memory loss show up?
A) Check the brain s cognitive reserve.
B) Stop medications affecting memory.
C) Turn to a professional for assistance.
D) Exercise to improve their well-being.
50. What is Dr. Daffner s advice for combating memory loss?
A) Having regular physical and mental checkups.
B) Taking medicine that helps boost one s brain.
C) Engaging in known memory repair activities.
D) Staying active both physically and mentally.Passage TwoQuestions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.A letter written by Charles Darwin in 1875 has been returned to the Smithsonian Institution Archives (档案馆) by the FBI after being stolen twice.
"We realized in the mid-1970s that it was missing," says Effie Kapsalis, head of the Smithsonian Insitution Archives. "It was noted as missing and likely taken by an intern (实习生), from what the FBI is telling us. Word got out that it was missing when someone asked to see the letter for research purposes," and the intern put the letter back. "The intern likely took the letter again once nobody was watching it."
Decades passed. Finally, the FBI received a tip that the stolen document was located very close to Washington, D.C. Their art crime team recovered the letter but were unable to press charges because the time of limitations had ended. The FBI worked closely with the Archives to determine that the letter was both authentic and definitely Smithsonian s property.
The letter was written by Darwin to thank an American geologist, Dr. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, for sending him copies of his research into the geology of the region that would become Yellowstone National Park.
The letter is in fairly good condition, in spite of being out of the care of trained museum staff for so long. "It was luckily in good shape," says Kapsalis, "and we just have to do some minor things in order to be able to unfold it. It has some glue on it that has colored it slightly, but nothing that will prevent us from using it. After it is repaired, we will take digital photos of it and that will be available online. One of our goals is to get items of high research value or interest to the public online."
It would now be difficult for an intern, visitor or a thief to steal a document like this. "Archiving practices have changed greatly since the 1970s," says Kapsalis, "and we keep our high value documents in a safe that I don t even have access to."
51. What happened to Darwin s letter in the 1970s?
A) It was recovered by the FBI.
B) It was stolen more than once.
C) It was put in the archives for research purposes.
D) It was purchased by the Smithsonian Archives.
52. What did the FBI do after the recovery of the letter?
A) They proved its authenticity.
B) They kept it in a special safe.
C) They arrested the suspect immediately.
D) They pressed criminal charges in vain.
53. What is Darwin s letter about?
A) The evolution of Yellowstone National Park.
B) His cooperation with an American geologist.
C) Some geological evidence supporting his theory.
D) His acknowledgement of help from a professional.
54. What will the Smithsonian Institution Archives do with the letter according to Kapsalis?
A) Reserve it for research purposes only.
B) Turn it into an object of high interest.
C) Keep it a permanent secret.
D) Make it available online.
55. What has the past half century witnessed according to Kapsalis?
A) Growing interest in rare art objects.
B) Radical changes in archiving practices.
C) Recovery of various missing documents.
D) Increases in the value of museum exhibits.Part Ⅲ Reading Comprehension (40 minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks.

"Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you re paying $ 120," said Senack. "But because it s all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out."
E) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015—pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120—a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.
F) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. "It s a balancing act," she said. "Can I really afford these access codes now?" She didn t hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.
G) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they re the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 "was derived from digital products."
H) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that "digital materials are less expensive and a good investment" that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn t respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that "in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over."
I) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. "These digital products aren t just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features," David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. "It helps students understand in a way that you can t do with print homework assignments."
J) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn t require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. "I try to make things as inexpensive as possible," said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. "The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I m giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most."
K) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn t require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. "That s two months of rent," she said. "You can t sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester s books. With an access code, you re out of that money. "
L) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that "it s ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework." Many of the access codes he s purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. "Often it s only 10% of your grade in class." he said. "You re paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade—but if you didn t have it, it would affect your grades enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C." Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.
M) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can t be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.
N) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. "We don t really have a missed assignment policy," she said. "If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it s not fun."
36. A student s yearly expenses on access codes may amount to their rent for two months.
37. The online access codes may be seen as a way to tie the students to the digital system.
38. If a student takes a course again, they may have to buy a new access code to submit their assignments.
39. McGraw Hill accounts for over one-fifth of the market share of college textbooks.
40. Many traditional textbook publishers are now offering online digital products, which they believe will be the future of the publishing business.
41. One student complained that they now had to pay for access codes in addition to the high tuition.
42. Digital materials can cost students less than half the price of traditional printed books according to a publisher.
43. One student decided not to buy her access code until she received the pay for her part-time job.
44. Online systems may deprive teachers of opportunities to make the best use of their expertise for their students.
45. Digital access codes are criticized because they are profit-driven just like the textbook business.Section CDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.Losing your ability to think and remember is pretty scary. We know the risk of dementia (痴呆症) increases with age. But if you have memory slips, you probably needn t worry. There are pretty clear differences between signs of dementia and age-related memory loss.
After age 50, it s quite common to have trouble remembering the names of people, places and things quickly, says Dr. Kirk Daffner of Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston.
The brain ages just like the rest of the body. Certain parts shrink, especially areas in the brain that are important to learning, memory and planning. Changes in brain cells can affect communication between different regions of the brain. And blood flow can be reduced as blood vessels narrow.
Forgetting the name of an actor in a favorite movie, for example, is nothing to worry about. But if you forget the plot of the movie or don t remember even seeing it, that s far more concerning, Daffner says.
When you forget entire experiences, he says, that s "a red flag that something more serious may be involved." Forgetting how to operate a familiar object like a microwave oven, or forgetting how to drive to the house of a friend you ve visited many times before can also be signs of something going wrong.
But even then, Daffner says, people shouldn t panic. There are many things that can cause confusion and memory loss, including health problems like temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, high blood pressure, or depression, as well as medications (药物) like antidepressants.
You don t have to figure this out on your own. Daffner suggests going to your doctor to check on medications, health problems and other issues that could be affecting memory. And the best defense against memory loss is to try to prevent it by building up your brain s cognitive (认知的) reserve, Daffner says.
"Read books, go to movies, take on new hobbies or activities that force one to think in novel ways," he says. In other words, keep your brain busy and working. And also get physically active, because exercise is a known brain booster.

"We realized in the mid-1970s that it was missing," says Effie Kapsalis, head of the Smithsonian Insitution Archives. "It was noted as missing and likely taken by an intern (实习生), from what the FBI is telling us. Word got out that it was missing when someone asked to see the letter for research purposes," and the intern put the letter back. "The intern likely took the letter again once nobody was watching it."
Decades passed. Finally, the FBI received a tip that the stolen document was located very close to Washington, D.C. Their art crime team recovered the letter but were unable to press charges because the time of limitations had ended. The FBI worked closely with the Archives to determine that the letter was both authentic and definitely Smithsonian s property.
The letter was written by Darwin to thank an American geologist, Dr. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, for sending him copies of his research into the geology of the region that would become Yellowstone National Park.
The letter is in fairly good condition, in spite of being out of the care of trained museum staff for so long. "It was luckily in good shape," says Kapsalis, "and we just have to do some minor things in order to be able to unfold it. It has some glue on it that has colored it slightly, but nothing that will prevent us from using it. After it is repaired, we will take digital photos of it and that will be available online. One of our goals is to get items of high research value or interest to the public online."
It would now be difficult for an intern, visitor or a thief to steal a document like this. "Archiving practices have changed greatly since the 1970s," says Kapsalis, "and we keep our high value documents in a safe that I don t even have access to."
51. What happened to Darwin s letter in the 1970s?
A) It was recovered by the FBI.
B) It was stolen more than once.
C) It was put in the archives for research purposes.
D) It was purchased by the Smithsonian Archives.
52. What did the FBI do after the recovery of the letter?
A) They proved its authenticity.
B) They kept it in a special safe.
C) They arrested the suspect immediately.
D) They pressed criminal charges in vain.
53. What is Darwin s letter about?
A) The evolution of Yellowstone National Park.
B) His cooperation with an American geologist.
C) Some geological evidence supporting his theory.
D) His acknowledgement of help from a professional.
54. What will the Smithsonian Institution Archives do with the letter according to Kapsalis?
A) Reserve it for research purposes only.
B) Turn it into an object of high interest.
C) Keep it a permanent secret.
D) Make it available online.
55. What has the past half century witnessed according to Kapsalis?
A) Growing interest in rare art objects.

This explains why reading skills should be highly emphasized.
Then how to improve our reading skills? First of all, scan the material before we begin. Whatever the purpose of our reading is, take a few minutes to look the piece over to check and see how the work is structured and presented. Secondly, try not to reach for the dictionary when we come to a word we don t know. Instead, try to guess the meaning of the word based on the context.

Today, with the development of China s economy and the improvement of people s living standards, more and more Chinese people, including many farmers and migrant workers, can travel by air. They can fly to all major cities, and many other cities are also planning to build airports. Air services continue to improve, and there are often cheap flights. In recent years, the number of people choosing to travel by air during holidays has been increasing.
