For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:	In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows.	Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of “trash talk（废话）”. The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society’s moral catastrophes（灾难）, yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments（困境）of other people’s lives.	Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual’s quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.	Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a “final word”. He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.	Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show’s main target audience are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time. Money, and stability to deal with life’s tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18- to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show’s exploitation.	While the two shows are as different as night and day. Both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.21.	Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are ________________.	A) more family-oriented	B) unusually popular	C) more profound	D) relatively formal22.	Though the social problems Jerry Springer talks about appear distasteful, the audience _________.	A) remain fascinated by them	B) are ready to face up to them	C) remain indifferent to them	D) are willing to get involved in them23.	Which of the following is likely to be a topic of the Oprah Winfrey show?	A) A new type of robot.	B) Racist hatred.	C) Family budget planning.	D) Street violence.24.	Despite their different approaches, the two talk shows are both ____________.	A) ironical	B) sensitive	C) instructive	D) cynical25.	We can learn from the passage that the two talk shows ___________.	A) have monopolized the talk show circuit	B) exploit the weaknesses in human nature	C) appear at different times of the day	D) are targeted at different audiencesPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	To understand the marketing concept, it is only necessary to understand the difference between marketing and selling. Not too many years ago, most industries concentrated primarily on the efficient production of goods, and then relied on “persuasive salesmanship” to move as much of these goods as possible. Such production and selling focuses on the needs of the seller to produce goods and then convert them into money.	Marketing, on the other hand, focuses on the wants of consumers. It begins with first analyzing the preferences and demands of consumers and then producing goods that will satisfy them. This eye-on-the-consumer approach is known as the marketing concept, which simply means that instead of trying to sell whatever is easiest to produce or buy for resale, the makers and dealers first endeavor to find out what the consumer wants to buy and then go about making it available for purchase.	This concept does not imply that business is benevolent（慈善的）or that consumer satisfaction is given priority over profit in a company. There are always two sides to every business transaction – the firm and the customer – and each must be satisfied before trade occurs. Successful merchants and producers, however, recognize that the surest route to profit is through understanding and catering to customers. A striking example of the importance of catering to the consumer presented itself in mid-1985, when Coca Cola changed the flavor of its drink. The non-acceptance of the new flavor by a significant portion of the public brought about a prompt restoration of the Classic Coke, which was then marketed alongside the new King Customer ruled!26.	The marketing concept discussed in the passage is, in essence, ____________.	A) the practice of turning goods into money	B) making goods available for purchase	C) the customer-centred approach	D) a form of persuasive salesmanship27.	What was the main concern of industrialists before the marketing concept was widely accepted?	A) The needs of the market.	B) The efficiency of production.	C) The satisfaction of the user.	D) The preferences of the dealer.28.	According to the passage, “to move as much of these goods as possible” (Lines 3-4, . I) means “_______________”.	A) to sell the largest possible amount of goods	B) to transport goods as efficiently as possible	C) to dispose of these goods in large quantities	D) to redesign these goods for large-scale production29.	What does the restoration of the Classic Coke best illustrate?	A) Traditional goods have a stronger appeal to the majority of people.	B) It takes time for a new product to be accepted by the public.	C) Consumers with conservative tastes are often difficult to please.	D) Products must be designed to suit the taste of the consumer.30.	In discussing the marketing concept, the author focuses on ___________.	A) its main characteristic	B) its social impact	C) its possible consequence	D) its theoretical basisPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	Conventional wisdom about conflict seems pretty much cut and dried. Too little conflict breeds apathy（冷漠）and stagnation（呆滞）. Too much conflict leads to divisiveness（分裂） and hostility. Moderate levels of conflict, however, can spark creativity and motivate people in a healthy and competitive way.	Recent research by Professor Charles R. Schwenk, however, suggests that the optimal level of conflict may be more complex to determine than these simple generalizations. He studied perceptions of conflict among a sample of executives. Some of the executives worked for profit-seeking organizations and others for not-for-profit organizations.	Somewhat surprisingly, Schwenk found that opinions about conflict varied systematically as a function of the type of organization. Specifically, managers in not-for-profit organizations strongly believed that conflict was beneficial to their organizations and that it promoted higher quality decision making than might be achieved in the absence of conflict.	Managers of for-profit organizations saw a different picture. They believed that conflict generally was damaging and usually led to poor-quality decision making in their organizations. Schwenk interpreted these results in terms of the criteria for effective decision making suggested by the executives. In the profit-seeking organizations, decision-making effectiveness was most often assessed in financial terms. The executives believed that consensus rather than conflict enhanced financial indicators.	In the not-for-profit organizations, decision-making effectiveness was defined from the perspective of satisfying constituents. Given the complexities and ambiguities associated with satisfying many diverse constituents executives perceived that conflict led to more considered and acceptable decisions.31.	In the eyes of the author, conventional opinion on conflict is ___________.	A) wrong	B) oversimplified	C) misleading	D) unclear32.	Professor Charles R. Schwenk’s research shows _______________.	A) the advantages and disadvantages of conflict	B) the real value of conflict	C) the difficulty in determining the optimal level of conflict	D) the complexity of defining the roles of conflict33.	We can learn from Schwenk’s research that ___________.	A) a person’s view of conflict is influenced by the purpose of his organization	B) conflict is necessary for managers of for-profit organizations	C) different people resolve conflicts in different ways	D) it is impossible for people to avoid conflict34.	The passage suggests that in for-profit organizations ____________.	A) there is no end of conflict	B) expression of different opinions is encouraged	C) decisions must be justifiable	D) success lies in general agreement35.	People working in a not-for-profit organization _____________.	A) seem to be difficult to satisfy	B) are free to express diverse opinions	C) are less effective in making decisions	D) find it easier to reach agreementPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:	Imagine eating everything delicious you want—with none of the fat. That would be great, wouldn’t it?	New “fake fat” products appeared on store shelves in the  recently, but not everyone is happy about it. Makers of the products, which contain a compound called olestra, say food manufacturers can now eliminate fat from certain foods. Critics, however, say the new compound can rob the body of essential vitamins and nutrients（营养物）and can also cause unpleasant side effects in some people. So it’s up to consumers to decide whether the new fat-free products taste good enough to keep eating.	Chemists discovered olestra in the late 1960s, when they were searching for a fat that could be digested by infants more easily. Instead of finding the desired fat, the researchers created a fat that can’t be digested at all.	Normally, special chemicals in the intestines（肠） “grab” molecules of regular fat and break them down so they can be used by the body. A molecule of regular fat is made up of three molecule of substances called fatty acids.	The fatty acids are absorbed by the intestines and bring with them the essential vitamins A, D, E, and K. When fat molecules are present in the intestines with any of those vitamins, the vitamins attach to the molecules and are carried into the bloodstream.	Olestra, which is made from six to eight molecules of fatty acids, is too large for the intestines to absorb. It just slides through the intestines without being broken down. Manufacturers say it’s that ability to slide unchanged through the intestines that makes olestra so valuable as a fat substitute. It provides consumers with the taste of regular fat without any bad effects on the body. But critics say olestra can prevent vitamins A, D, E, and K from being absorbed. It can also prevent the absorption of carotenoids（类胡萝卜素）, compounds that may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease, etc.	Manufacturers are adding vitamins A, D, E, and K as well as carotenoids to their products now. Even so, some nutritionists are still concerned that people might eat unlimited amounts of food made with the fat substitute without worrying about how many calories they are consuming.36.	We learn from the passage that olestra is a substance that ______________.	A) contains plenty of nutrients	B) renders foods calorie-free while retaining their vitamins	C) makes foods easily digestible	D) makes foods fat-free while keeping them delicious37.	The result of the search for an easily digestible fat turned out to be ____________.	A) commercially useless	B) just as anticipated	C) somewhat controversial	D) quite unexpected38.	Olestra is different from ordinary fats in that _____________.	A) it passes through the intestines without being absorbed	B) it facilitates the absorption of vitamins by the body	C) it helps reduce the incidence of heart disease	D) it prevents excessive intake of vitamins39.	What is a possible negative effect of olestra according to some critics?	A) It may impair the digestive system.	B) It may affect the overall fat intake.	C) It may increase the risk of cancer.	D) It many spoil the consumers’ appetite.40.	Why are nutritionists concerned about adding vitamins to olestra?	A) It may lead to the over-consumption of vitamins.	B) People may be induced to eat more than is necessary.	C) The function of the intestines may be weakened.	D) It may trigger a new wave of fake food production.Part III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:	In the 1920s demand for American farm products fell, as European countries began to recover from World War I and instituted austerity（紧缩）programs to reduce their imports. The result was a sharp drop in farm prices. This period was more disastrous for farmers than earlier times had been, because farmers were no longer self-sufficient. They were paying for machinery, seed, and fertilizer, and they were also buying consumer goods. The prices of the items farmers bought remained constant, while prices they received for their products fell. These developments were made worse by the Great Depression, which began in 1929 and extended throughout the 1930s	In 1929, under President Herbert Hoover, the Federal Farm Board was organized. It established the principle of direct interference with supply and demand, and it represented the first national commitment to provide greater economic stability for farmers.	President Hoover’s successor attached even more importance to this problem. One of the first measures proposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he took office in 1933 was the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which was subsequently passed by Congress. This law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the grounds that general taxes were being collected to pay one special group of people. However, new laws were passed immediately that achieved the same result of resting soil and providing flood-control measures, but which were based on the principle of soil conservation. The Roosevelt Administration believed that rebuilding the nation’s soil was in the national interest and was not simply a plan to help farmers at the expense of other citizens. Later the government guaranteed loans to farmers so that they could buy farm machinery, hybrid（杂交）grain, and fertilizers. 21.	What brought about the decline in the demand for American farm products?	A) The impact of the Great Depression.	B) The shrinking of overseas markets.	C) The destruction caused by the First World War.	D) The increased exports of European countries.22.	The chief concern of the American government in the area of agriculture in the 1920s was ____________________.	A) to increase farm production	B) to establish agricultural laws	C) to prevent farmers from going bankrupt	D) to promote the mechanization of agriculture23.	The Agricultural Adjustment Act encouraged American farmers to __________.	A) reduce their scale of production	B) make full use of their land	C) adjust the prices of their farm products	D) be self-sufficient in agricultural production24.	The Supreme Court rejected the Agricultural Adjustment Act because it believed that the Act ______________.

It was claimed that the new laws passed during the Roosevelt Administration were aimed at _______________.	A) reducing the cost of farming	B) conserving soil in the long-term interest of the nation	C) lowering the burden of farmers	D) helping farmers without shifting the burden onto other taxpayersPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	In the 1950s, the pioneers of artificial intelligence (AI) predicted that, by the end of this century, computers would be conversing with us at work and robots would be performing our housework. But as useful as computers are, they’re nowhere close to achieving anything remotely resembling these early aspirations for humanlike behavior. Never mind something as complex as conversation: the most powerful computers struggle to reliably recognize the shape of an object, the most elementary of tasks for a ten-month-old kid.	A growing group of AI researchers think they know where the field went wrong. The problem, the scientists say, is that AI has been trying to separate the highest, most abstract levels of thought, like language and mathematics, and to duplicate them with logical, step-by-step programs. A new movement in AI, on the other hand, takes a closer look at the more roundabout way in which nature came up with intelligence. Many of these researchers study evolution and natural adaptation instead of formal logic and conventional computer programs. Rather than digital computers and transistors, some want to work with brain cells and proteins. The results of these early efforts are as promising as they are peculiar, and the new nature-based AI movement is slowly but surely moving to the forefront of the field.	Imitating the brain’s neural（神经的）network is a huge step in the right direction, says computer scientist and biophysicist Michael Conrad, but it still misses an important aspect of natural intelligence. “People tend to treat the brain as if it were made up of color-coded transistors,” he explains, “but it’s not simply a clever network of switches. There are lots of important things going on inside the brain cells themselves.” Specifically, Conrad believes that many of the brain’s capabilities stem from the pattern-recognition proficiency of the individual molecules that make up each brain cell. The best way to build an artificially intelligent device, he claims, would be to build it around the same sort of molecular skills.	Right now, the notion that conventional computers and software are fundamentally incapable of matching the processes that take place in the brain remains controversial. But if it proves true, then the efforts of Conrad and his fellow AI rebels could turn out to be the only game in town.26.	The author says that the powerful computers of today _______________.	A) are capable of reliably recognizing the shape of an object	B) are close to exhibiting humanlike behavior	C) are not very different in their performance from those of the s	D) still cannot communicate with people in a human language27.	The new trend in artificial intelligence research stems from ____________.	A) the shift of the focus of study on to the recognition of the shapes of objectsB) the belief that human intelligence cannot be duplicated with logical, step-by-step programs	C) the aspirations of scientists to duplicate the intelligence of a ten-month-old childD) the efforts made by scientists in the study of the similarities between transistors and brain cells28.	Conrad and his group of AI researchers have been making enormous efforts to _______.	A) find a roundabout way to design powerful computers	B) build a computer using a clever network of switches	C) find out how intelligence developed in nature	D) separate the highest and most abstract levels of thought29.	What’s the author’s opinion about the new AI movement?A) It has created a sensation among artificial intelligence researchers but will soon die out.	B) It’s breakthrough in duplicating human thought processes.	C) It’s more like a peculiar game rather than a real scientific effort.	D) It may prove to be in the right direction though nobody is sure of its future prospects.30.	Which of the following is closest in meaning to the phrase “the only game in town” (Line 3, Para.4)?	A) The only approach to building an artificially intelligent computer.	B) The only way for them to win a prize in artificial intelligence research.	C) The only area worth studying in computer science.	D) The only game they would like to play in town.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	Cars account for half the oil consumed in the U.S., about half the urban pollution and one fourth the greenhouse（温室）gases. They take a similar toll of（损耗）resources in other industrial nations and in the cities of the developing world. As vehicle use continues to increase in the coming decade, the  and other countries will have to deal with these issues or else face unacceptable economic, health-related and political costs. It is unlikely that oil prices will remain at their current low level or that other nations will accept a large and growing  contribution to global climatic change.	Policymakers and industry have four options: reduce vehicle use, increase the efficiency and reduce the emissions of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, switch to less harmful fuels, or find less polluting driving systems. The last of these-in particular the introduction of vehicles powered by electricity—is ultimately the only sustainable option. The other alternatives are attractive in theory but in practice are either impractical or offer only marginal improvements. For example, reduced vehicle use could solve traffic problems and a host of social and environmental problems, but evidence from around the world suggests that it is very difficult to make people give up their cars to any significant extent. In the U.S., mass-transit tidership and carpooling（合伙用车）have declined since World War II. Even in western Europe, with fuel prices averaging more than $ liter (about $ gallon) and with easily accessible mass transit and dense populations, cars still account for 80 percent of all passenger travel.	Improved energy efficiency is also appealing, but automotive fuel economy has barely made any progress in 10 years. Alternative fuels such as natural gas, burned in internal-combustion engines, could be introduced at relatively low cost, but they would lead to only marginal reductions in pollution and greenhouse emissions (especially because oil companies are already spending billions of dollars every year to develop less polluting types of gasoline).31.	From the passage we know that the increased use of cars will ______________.	A) consume half of the oil produced in the world	B) have serious consequences for the well-being of all nations	C) widen the gap between the developed and developing countries	D) impose an intolerable economic burden on residents of large cities32.	The  has to deal with the problems arising from vehicle use because __________.	A) most Americans are reluctant to switch to public transportation systems	B) the present level of oil prices is considered unacceptable	C) other countries will protest its increasing greenhouse emissions	D) it should take a lead in conserving natural resources33.	Which of the following is the best solution to the problems mentioned in the passage?	A) The designing of highly efficient car engines.	B) A reduction of vehicle use in cities.	C) The development of electric cars.	D) The use of less polluting fuels.34.	Which of the following is practical but only makes a marginal contribution to solving the problem of greenhouse emissions?	A) The use of fuels other than gasoline.	B) Improved energy efficiency.	C) The introduction of less polluting driving systems.	D) Reducing car use by carpooling.35.	Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	A) The decline of public transportation accounts for increased car use in western Europe.	B) Car are popular in western Europe even though fuel prices are fairly high.C) The reduction of vehicle use is the only sustainable option in densely populated western Europe.D) Western European oil companies cannot sustain the cost of developing new-type fuels.Passage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:	Reebok executives do not like to hear their stylish athletic shoes called “footwear for yuppies（雅皮士，少壮高薪职业人士）”. They contend that Reebok shoes appeal to diverse market segments, especially now that the company offers basketball and children’s shoes for the under-18 set and walking shoes for older customers not interested in aerobics（健身操）or running. The executives also point out that through recent acquisitions they have added hiking boots, dress and casual shoes, and high-performance athletic footwear to their product lines, all of which should attract new and varied groups of customers.	Still, despite its emphasis on new markets, Reehok plans few changes in the upmakeret（高档消费人群的）retailing network that helped push sales to $1 billion annually, ahead of all other sports shoe marketers. Reebok shoes, which are priced form $27 to $85, will continue to be sold only in better specialty, sporting goods, and department stores, in accordance with the company’s view that consumers judge the quality of the brand by the quality of its distribution.	In the past few years, the Massachusetts-based company has imposed limits on the number of its distributors (and the number of shoes supplied to stores), partly out of necessity. At times the unexpected demand for Reebok’s exceeded supply, and the company could barely keep up with orders from the dealers it already had. These fulfillment problems seem to be under control now, but the company is still selective about its distributors. At present, Reebok shoes are available in about five thousand retail stores in the .	Reebok has already anticipated that walking shoes will be the next fitness-related craze, replacing aerobics shoes the same way its brightly colored, soft leather exercise footwear replaced conventional running shoes. Through product diversification and careful market research, Reebok hopes to avoid the distribution problems Nike came across several years ago, when Nike misjudged the strength of the aerobics shoe craze and was forced to unload huge inventories of running shoes through discount stores.36.	One reason why Reebok’s managerial personnel don’t like their shoes to be called “footwear for yuppies” is that _____________.	A) they believe that their shoes are popular with people of different age groups	B) new production lines have been added to produce inexpensive shoes	C) “yuppies” usually evokes a negative image	D) the term makes people think of prohibitive prices37.	Reekbok’s view that “consumers judge the quality of the brand by the quality of its distribution” (Line 5, Para.2) implies that ____________.	A) the quality of a brand is measured by the service quality of the store selling it	B) the quality of a product determines the quality of its distributors	C) the popularity of a brand is determined by the stores that sell it	D) consumers believe that first-rate products are only sold by high-quality stores38.	Reebok once had to limit the number of its distributors because ____________.	A) its supply of products fell short of demand	B) too many distributors would cut into its profits	C) the reduction of distributors could increase its share of the market	D) it wanted to enhance consumer confidence in its products39.	Although the Reebok Company has solved the problem of fulfilling its orders, it ______.	A) does not want to further expand its retailing network	B) still limits the number of shoes supplied to stores	C) is still particular about who sells its products	D) still carefully chooses the manufacturers of its products40.	What lesson has Reebok learned from Nike’s distribution problems?	A) A company should not sell its high quality shoes in discount stores.	B) A company should not limit its distribution network.	C) A company should do follow-up surveys of its products.	D) A company should correctly evaluate the impact of a new craze on the market.Part III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage:	Birds that are literally half-asleep—with one brain hemisphere alert and the other sleeping—control which side of the brain remains awake, according to a new study of sleeping ducks.	Earlier studies have documented half-brain sleep in a wide range of birds. The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere’s eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once.	Earlier studies have documented half-brain sleep in a wide range of birds. The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere’s eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once.	Decades of studies of bird flocks led researchers to predict extra alertness in the more vulnerable, end-of-the-row sleepers, Sure enough, the end birds tended to watch carefully on the side away from their companions. Ducks in the inner spots showed no preference for gaze direction.	Also, birds dozing（打盹）at the end of the line resorted to single-hemisphere sleep, rather than total relaxation, more often than inner ducks did. Rotating 16 birds through the positions in a four-duck row, the researchers found outer birds half-asleep during some 32 percent of dozing time versus about 12 percent for birds in internal spots.	“We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain,” the researchers say.	The results provide the best evidence for a long-standing supposition that single-hemisphere sleep evolved as creatures scanned for enemies. The preference for opening an eye on the lookout side could be widespread, he predicts. He’s seen it in a pair of birds dozing side-by-side in the zoo and in a single pet bird sleeping by mirror. The mirror-side eye closed as if the reflection were a companion and the other eye stayed open.	Useful as half-sleeping might be, it’s only been found in birds and such water mammals（哺乳动物）as dolphins, whales, and seals. Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning.	Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep. Jerome M. Siegel of the UGLA says he wonders if birds’ half-brain sleep “is just the tip of the iceberg（冰山）”. He speculates that more examples may turn up when we take a closer look at other species.11.	A new study on birds’ sleep has revealed that ____________.	A) birds can control their half-brain sleep consciously	B) birds seldom sleep with the whole of their brain at rest	C) half-brain sleep is found in a wide variety of birds	D) half-brain sleep is characterized by slow brain waves12.	According to the passage, birds often half sleep because ______________.	A) they have to constantly keep an eye on their companions	B) the two halves of their brain are differently structured	C) they have to watch out for possible attacks	D) their brain hemisphere take turns to rest13.	The example of a bird sleeping in front of a mirror indicates that _____________.	A) birds prefer to sleep in pairs for the sake of security	B) the phenomenon of birds dozing in pairs is widespread	C) a single pet bird enjoys seeing its own reflection in the mirror	D) even an imagined companion gives the bird a sense of security14.	While sleeping, some water mammals tend to keep half awake in order to __________.	A) avoid being swept away by rapid currents	B) emerge from water now and then to breathe	C) alert themselves to the approaching enemy	D) be sensitive to the ever-changing environment15.	By “just the tip of the iceberg” (Line 2, Para.8), Siegel suggests that ____________.	A) half-brain sleep is a phenomenon that could exist among other species	B) most birds living in cold regions tend to be half sleepers	C) the mystery of half-brain sleep is close to being solved	D) half-brain sleep has something to do with icy weatherPassage TwoQuestions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage:	A nine-year-old schoolgirl single-handedly cooks up a science-fair experiment that ends up debunking（揭穿．．．的真相）a widely practiced medical treatment. Emily Rosa’s target was a practice known as therapeutic（治疗）touch (TT for short), whose advocates manipulate patients’ “energy field” to make them feel better and even, say some, to cure them of various ills. Yet Emily’s test shows that these energy fields can’t be detected, even by trained TT practitioners（行医者）. Obviously mindful of the publicity value of the situation, Journal editor George Lundberg appeared on TV to declare, “Age doesn’t matter. It’s good science that matters, and this is good science.”	Emily’s mother Linda Rosa, a registered nurse, has been campaigning against TT for nearly a decade. Linda first thought about TT in the late ’80s, when she learned it was on the approved list for continuing nursing education in . Its 100,000 trained practitioners ( the ) don’t even touch their patients. Instead, they waved their hands a few inches from the patient’s body, pushing energy fields around until they’re in “balance.” TT advocates say these manipulations can help heal wounds, relieve pain and reduce fever. The claims are taken seriously enough that TT therapists are frequently hired by leading hospitals, at up to $70 an hour, the smooth patients’ energy, sometimes during surgery.	Yet  could not find any evidence that it works. To provide such proof, TT therapists would have to sit down for independent testing—something they haven’t been eager to do, even though James Randi has offered more than $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate the existence of a human energy field. (He’s had one taker so far. She failed.) A skeptic might conclude that TT practitioners are afraid to lay their beliefs on the line. But who could turn down an innocent fourth-grader? Says Emily: “I think they didn’t take me very seriously because I’m a kid.”	The experiment was straightforward: 21 TT therapists stuck their hands, palms up, through a screen. Emily held her own hand over one of theirs—left or right—and the practitioners had to say which hand it was. When the results were recorded, they’d done no better than they would have by simply guessing. if there was an energy field, they couldn’t feel it. 16.	Which of the following is evidence that TT is widely practiced?	A) TT has been in existence for decades.	B) Many patients were cured by therapeutic touch.	C) TT therapists are often employed by leading hospitals.	D) More than 100,000 people are undergoing TT treatment.17.	Very few TT practitioners responded to the $1 million offer because ____________.	A) they didn’t take the offer seriously	B) they didn’t want to risk their career	C) they were unwilling to reveal their secret	D) they thought it was not in line with their practice18.	The purpose of Emily Rosa’s experiment was ____________.	A) to see why TT could work the way it did	B) to find out how TT cured patient’s illness	C) to test whether she could sense the human energy field	D) to test whether a human energy field really existed19.	Why did some TT practitioners agree to be the subjects of Emily’s experiment?	A) It involved nothing more than mere guessing.	B) They thought it was going to be a lot of fun.	C) It was more straightforward than other experiments.	D) They sensed no harm in a little girl’s experiment.20.	What can we learn from the passage?	A) Some widely accepted beliefs can be deceiving.	B) Solid evidence weighs more than pure theories.	C) Little children can be as clever as trained TT practitioners.	D) The principle of TT is too profound to understand.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	What might driving on an automated highway be like? The answer depends on what kind of system is ultimately adopted. Two distinct types are on the drawing board. The first is a special—purpose lane system, in which certain lanes are reserved for automated vehicles. The second is a mixed traffic system: fully automated vehicles would share the road with partially automated or manually driven cars. A special-purpose land system would require more extensive physical modifications to existing highways, but it promises the greatest gains in freeway（高速公路）capacity.	Under either scheme, the driver would specify the desired destination, furnishing this information to a computer in the car at the beginning of the trip or perhaps just before reaching the automated highway. If a mixed traffic system was in place, automated driving could begin whenever the driver was on suitably equipped roads. If special-purpose lanes were available, the car could enter them and join existing traffic in two different ways. One method would use a special onramp（入口引道）. As the driver approached the point of entry for the highway, devices installed on the roadside would electronically check the vehicle to determine its destination and to ascertain that it had the proper automation equipment in good working order. Assuming it passed such tests, the driver would then be guided through a gate and toward an automated lane. In this case, the transition from manual to automated control would take place on the entrance ramp. An alternative technique could employ conventional lanes, which would be shared by automated and regular vehicles. The driver would steer onto the highway and move in normal fashion to a “transition” lane. The vehicle would then shift under computer control onto a lane reserved for automated traffic. (The limitation of these lanes to automated traffic would, presumably, be well respected, because all trespassers（非法进入者）could be swiftly identified by authorities.)	Either approach to joining, a lane of automated traffic would harmonize the movement of newly entering vehicles with those already traveling. Automatic control here should allow for smooth merging, without the usual uncertainties and potential for accidents. and once a vehicle had settled into automated travel, the drive would be free to release the wheel, open the morning paper or just relax.21.	We learn from the first paragraph that two systems of automated highways __________.	A) are being planned	B) are being modified	C) are now in wide use	D) are under construction22.	A special-purpose lane system is probably advantageous in that ________________.	A) it would require only minor changes to existing highways	B) it would achieve the greatest highway traffic efficiency	C) it has a lane for both automated and partially automated vehicles	D) it offers more lanes for automated vehicles23.	Which of the following is true about driving on an automated highway?A) Vehicles traveling on it are assigned different lanes according to their destinations.	B) A car can join existing traffic any time in a mixed lane system.C) The driver should inform his car computer of his destination before driving onto it.	D) The driver should share the automated lane with those of regular vehicles.24.	We know form the passage that a car can enter a special-purpose lane __________.	A) by smoothly merging with cars on the conventional lane	B) by way of a ramp with electronic control devices	C) through a specially guarded gate	D) after all trespassers are identified and removed25.	When driving in an automated lane, the driver ___________.	A) should harmonize with newly entering cars	B) doesn’t have to rely on his computer system	C) should watch out for potential accidents	D) doesn’t have to hold not to the steering wheelPassage FourQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths. At the top of the list is the notion that intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems; to read, write and compute at certain levels, and to resolve abstract equations quickly. This vision of intelligence asserts formal education and bookish excellence as the true measures of self-fulfillment. It encourages a kind of intellectual prejudice that has brought with it some discouraging results. We have come to believe that someone who has more educational merit badges, who is very good at some form of school discipline is “intelligent.” Yet mental hospitals are filled with patients who have all of the properly lettered certificates. A truer indicator of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.	If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person. Problem solving is a useful help to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent. You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N. B. D—Nervous Break Down.	“Intelligent” people do not have N. B. D.’s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the problems of their lives. You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances. The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us. Everyone who is involved with other human beings in any social context has similar difficulties. Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human. Similarly, money, growing old, sickness, deaths, natural disasters and accidents are all events which present problems to virtually all human beings. But some people are able to make it, to avoid immobilizing depression and unhappiness despite such occurrences, while others collapse or have an N. B. D. Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.26.	According to the author, the conventional notion of intelligence measured in terms of one’s ability to read, write and compute _____________.	A) is a widely held but wrong concept	B) will help eliminate intellectual prejudice	C) is the root of all mental distress	D) will contribute to one’s self-fulfillment27.	It is implied in the passage that holding a university degree _____________.	A) may result in one’s inability to solve complex real-life problems	B) does not indicate one’s ability to write properly worded documents	C) may make one mentally sick and physically weak	D) does not mean that one is highly intelligent28.	The author thinks that an intelligent person knows _____________.	A) how to put up with some very prevalent myths	B) how to find the best way to achieve success in life	C) how to avoid depression and make his life worthwhile	D) how to persuade others to compromise29.	In the last paragraph, the author tells us that _____________.	A) difficulties are but part of everyone’s life	B) depression and unhappiness are unavoidable in life	C) everybody should learn to avoid trying circumstances	D) good feelings can contribute to eventual academic excellence30.	According to the passage, what kind of people are rare?	A) Those who don’t emphasize bookish excellence in their pursuit of happiness.	B) Those who are aware of difficulties in life but know how to avoid unhappiness.C) Those who measure happiness by an absence of problems but seldom suffer form N. B. D.’s.D) Those who are able to secure happiness though having to struggle against trying circumstances.Part III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

PartⅡ Reading Comprehension11. 正确答案为C)。根据文章第1、3-6段可知，对鸟类睡眠的最新研究表明，它们能够有意识地控制自己的半脑睡眠。这几段举例说明了对这个问题实验的情况。选项A)、B)、D)虽在文章第2 段中也提到了，但那是文献记载的以前研究的情况(Earlier studies have documented...)故均不是正确答案。12. 正确答案为A)。根据文章第6段The results provide the best evidence for along standing supposition that singlehemisphere sleep evolved as creatures scanned for enemies.(这些研究结果为一个长久以来的假设提供了最好的证据，即单侧脑睡眠是在生物警惕敌人过程中进化形成的。)13. 正确答案为C)。根据文章第6段内容：鸟类单侧脑睡眠是在警惕敌人过程中进化而来，此结论还可推而广之。在需要警惕的一侧，鸟儿喜欢睁着一只眼睛……，一对动物园里的鸟儿挨着打瞌睡时 是如此，宠物鸟靠镜子一侧的眼睛闭着，好象镜子中的影子是一个伙伴，而另一只眼睛却睁着， 也说明这种情况。所以选项C)是答案。14. 正确答案为B)。根据文章第7段第2句Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning.(也许，保持一侧脑醒着可以使睡眠中的动物不时浮出水面而刁；淹死。)所以B)emerge from water now and then to breathe(不时浮出水面来呼吸)是正确答案。15. 正确答案为D)。根据文章最后的一段，也就是含有这个短语的上下文。Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep...He (Siegel)speculates that more examples may turn up when we take closer look at other species.(对鸟类的研究可能提供对睡眠的独特认识。……他推测当我们对其他物种仔细观察时，就会发现更多的例证。)因此选项D)所说"半侧脑睡眠这种现象可能存在于其他物种"正是"just the tip of iceberg"所表达的意思。16. 正确答案为C)。根据第2段The claims are taken seriously enough that TT therapists are frequently hired by leading hospitals.(这种宣扬很受重视，以致TT行医者经常受雇于大的医院……)选项A)文章中没有提及，选项B)叙述不准确，文中只是说，据称这种方法能使人病情好转，甚至说有的能治疗各种疾病"。选项D)与文章内容不符，文章说，川万受过培训的TT行医者甚至不接触病人身体……。故A)，B)，D) 均不是答案。17. 正确答案为C)。根据文章第3段第2句：为了提供这样一个证明(证明人有"能场'')，TT行医者不得不坐下接受独立的测试--这是他们一直都不愿意做的事情，即使詹姆斯·兰迪为能演示人存在"能场"的人提供一百多万美元的奖金。(To provide such proof, TT therapists would have to sit down for independent testingsomething they haven'tbeen eager to do, even though James Landi has offered more than $ 1 million to anyone who can demonstrate the existence of a human energy field.)18. 正确答案为D)。根据文章第1段我们知道，TT行医者所宣扬的就是通过调节病人?quot;能场"来治病（whose advocates manipulate patient's "energy field" to make them feel better and even, say some, to cure them of various ills）。在第2段中，又提到"运用这种手法可以推动能场转动直到平衡(…pushing energy fieds around until they're in "balance")"而爱米丽·瑞莎的实验就是证明是否能场真的存在。特别文章最后一句If there was an energy field, they couldn't feel it.(如果有一个能场的话，他们也感觉不到。)选项C)说是测试她能否感觉到能场，如果是这样的话，前提是存在一个能场，这当然是错误的。A)，B)两个选项也是错误的。19. 正确答案为D)。根据文章第3段从第2句到段末这部分：A skeptic might conclude that TT practitioners are afraid to lay their beliefs on the line. But who would turn down an innocent, fourthgrader?Says Emily:"I think they didn't take me very seriously because I'm a kid".(怀疑的人或许会因为TT行医者害怕使他们自己处于被揭露的危险中，但谁能拒绝一个天真的四年级的小学生呢?爱米丽说，"我想他们不会太把我当回事，因为我是个小孩子。)20. 正确答案为A)。此题要求概括主题。文章第1句就是主题句：A nineyearold schoolgirl singlehandly cooks up a sciencefair experiment the ends up debunking a widely practiced medical treatment. (一个9岁的小女孩独自设计了一个公开的科学实验，结果揭穿了一种广为流行的医疗方法的真相。)21. 正确答案为A)。根据第1段第2，3句：The answer depends on what kind of system is ultimately adopted. Two distinct types are on the drawing board. (答案取决于最后采用哪一种系统，两种不同的类型都在绘图板上。)回答此问题的关键是要知道drawingboard的意思。所以选项A) are being planned是正确答案。22. 正确答案为B)。根据第1段最后一句：A specialpurpose lane system would require more extensive physical modifications to existing highways,but it promises the greatest gains in freeway capacity (特别目的车道系统要求对现有的高速公路进行更广泛的改造，但它会使高速公路获得最大的能力。)23. 正确答案为C)。根据第2段第1句：Under either scheme, the driver would specify the desired destination, furnishing this information to a computer in the car at the beginning of the trip or perhaps just before reaching the automated highway.(不论采用那种设计，司机都需要在其开始行驶时或在到达自动化高速公路前确定要去的目的地，把这个信息输入车上的计算机。)故C)是正确答案。选项B)与文章内容相悖，因为原文第2段第2句是on suitably equipped roads而不是existing traffic。选项D)提到的情况只适用于第2种设计方案，即混合式交通系统。故A)，B)，D)均不是答案。24. 正确答案为B)。根据文章第2段第3，4，5句：如果使用特殊目的的车道……一种方法是使用特殊的人口引道。当司机接近高速公路人口处时，安装在道边的电子装置会检测车辆的目的地并搞清是否有能工作的自动化装置。(If specialpurpose lanes were available,…One method would use a special onramp. As drivers approached the point of entry for the highway, devices installed on the roadside would electronically check the vehicle to determine its destination and to ascertain that it had the proper automation equipment in good working order.)25. 正确答案为D)。根据第3段的最后一句：And once a vehicle had settled into automated travel, the driver would be free to release the wheel, open the morning paperor just relax. (一旦车辆进入自动行驶状态，司机就可以放开方向盘，打开晨报或者只是休息。) 26. 正确答案为A)。这是一篇新老观点对应性文章。老观点也就是平常的大家普遍接受的观点：聪明指的是受到正规教育，成绩优秀，并以此作为自我完善的手段。新观点强调心理健康，否定老观点，所以A)是答案。27. 正确答案为D)。通读全文我们知道，作者认为真正能体现聪明的是能否过一种有意义；愉快的生活，每天，每时都是这样。而获得大学学位的人未必能做到。所以选项D)与作者的这种观点相符，是正确答案。选项C)有一定的干扰性，虽然作者说神经病医院里满是持有各种证书的病人。但这并不是说持有大学学位可能使一个人神经得病或身体虚弱。28. 正确答案为C)。选项A)与文章内容相悖，文章说要摒弃某些很流行的说法(putting rest some very prevalent myths)，而不是要忍耐这些说法。选项B)和选项D)的内容在文章中均未提到， 故只有选项C)是正确答案。另外，也可以根据第2段第1句来推断：If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it's worth, then you are an intelligent person.

For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:	Our culture has caused most Americans to assume not only that our language is universal but that the gestures we use are understood by everyone. We do not realize that waving good-bye is the way to summon a person from the  to one’s side, or that in  and some Latin-American countries, curling the finger to oneself is a sign of farewell.	Those private citizens who sent packages to our troops occupying Germany after World War II and marked them GIFT to escape duty payments did not bother to find out that “Gift” means poison in German. Moreover, we like to think of ourselves as friendly, yet we prefer to be at least 3 feet or an arm’s length away form others. Latins and Middle Easterners like to come closer and touch, which makes Americans uncomfortable.	Our linguistic（语言上的）and cultural blindness and the casualness with which we take notice of the developed tastes, gestures, customs and languages of other countries, are losing us friends, business and respect in the world.	Even here in the , we make few concessions to the needs of foreign visitors. There are no information signs in four languages on our public buildings or monuments; we do not have multilingual（多语的）guided tours. Very few restaurant menus have translations, and multilingual waiters, bank clerks and policemen are rare. Our transportation systems have maps in English only and often we ourselves have difficulty understanding them.	When we go abroad, we tend to cluster in hotels and restaurants where English is spoken. The attitudes and information we pick up are conditioned by those natives—usually the richer—who speak English. Our business dealings, as well as the nation’s diplomacy, are conducted through interpreters.	For many years,  and Americans could get by with cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance. After all,  was the most powerful country of the free world, the distributor of needed funds and goods.	But all that is past. American dollars no longer buy all good things, and we are slowly beginning to realize that our proper role in the world is changing. A 1979 Harris poll reported that 55 percent of Americans want this country to play a more significant role in world affairs; we want to have a hand in the important decisions of the next century, even though it may not always be the upper hand.21.	It can be inferred that Americans being approached too closely by Middle Easterners would most probably ______________.	A) stand still	B) jump aside	C) step forward	D) draw back22.	The author gives many examples to criticize Americans for their ___________.	A) cultural self-centeredness	B) casual manners 	C) indifference toward foreign visitors	D) arrogance towards other cultures23.	In countries other than their own most Americans _______________.	A) are isolated by the local people	B) are not well informed due to the language barrier	C) tend to get along well with the natives	D) need interpreters in hotels and restaurants24.	According to the author, Americans’ cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance will ____________.	A) affect their image in the new era	B) cut themselves off from the outside world	C) limit their role in world affairs	D) weaken the position of the US dollar25.	The author’s intention in writing this article is to make Americans realize that ________.	A) it is dangerous to ignore their foreign friends	B) it is important to maintain their leading role in world affairs	C) it is necessary to use several languages in public places	D) it is time to get acquainted with other culturesPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	In department stores and closets all over the world, they are waiting. Their outward appearance seems rather appealing because they come in a variety of styles, textures, and colors. But they are ultimately the biggest deception that exists in the fashion industry today. What are they? They are high heels — a woman’s worst enemy (whether she knows it or not). High heel shoes are the downfall of modern society. Fashion myths have led women to believe that they are more beautiful or sophisticated for wearing heels, but in reality, heels succeed in posing short as well as long term hardships. Women should fight the high heel industry by refusing to use or purchase them in order to save the world from unnecessary physical and psychological suffering.	For the sake of fairness, it must be noted that there is a positive side to high heels. First, heels are excellent for aerating（使通气）lawns. Anyone who has ever worn heels on grass knows what I am talking about. A simple trip around the yard in a pair of those babies eliminates all need to call for a lawn care specialist, and provides the perfect-sized holes to give any lawn oxygen without all those messy chunks of dirt lying around. Second, heels are quite functional for defense against oncoming enemies, who can easily be scared away by threatening them with a pair of these sharp, deadly fashion accessories.	Regardless of such practical uses for heels, the fact remains that wearing high heels is harmful to one’s physical health. Talk to any podiatrist（足病医生）, and you will hear that the majority of their business comes from high-heel-wearing women. High heels are known to cause problems such as deformed feet and torn toenails. The risk of severe back problems and twisted or broken ankles is three times higher for a high heel wearer than for a flat shoe wearer. Wearing heels also creates the threat of getting a heel caught in a sidewalk crack or a sewer-grate（阴沟栅）and being thrown to the ground—possibly breaking a nose, back, or neck. And of course, after wearing heels for a day, any woman knows she can look forward to a night of pain as she tries to comfort her swollen, aching feet.26.	What makes women blind to the deceptive nature of high heels?	A) The multi-functional use of high heels.	B) Their attempt to show off their status.	C) The rich variety of high heel styles.	D) Their wish to improve their appearance.27.	The author’s presentation of the positive side of high heels is meant ______________.	A) to be ironic	B) to poke fun at women	C) to be fair to the fashion industry	D) to make his point convincing28.	The author uses the expression “those babies” (Line 3, Para.2) to refer to high heels __________.	A) to show their fragile characteristics	B) to indicate their feminine features	C) to show women’s affection for them	D) to emphasize their small size29.	The author’s chief argument against high heels is that ____________.	A) they pose a threat to lawns	B) they are injurious to women’s health	C) they don’t necessarily make women beautiful	D) they are ineffective as a weapon of defense30.	It can be inferred from the passage that women should _______________.	A) see through the very nature of fashion myths	B) boycott the products of the fashion industry	C) go to a podiatrist regularly for advice	D) avoid following fashion too closelyPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	It is hardly necessary for me to cite all the evidence of the depressing state of literacy. These figures from the Department of Education are sufficient: 27 million Americans cannot read at all, and a further 35 million read at a level that is less than sufficient to survive in our society.	But my own worry today is less that of the overwhelming problem of elemental literacy than it is of the slightly more luxurious problem of the decline in the skill even of he middle-class reader, of his unwillingness to afford those spaces of silence, those luxuries of domesticity and time and concentration, that surround the image of the classic act of reading. it has been suggested that almost 80 percent of America’s literate, educated teenagers can no longer read without an accompanying noise (music) in the background or a television screen flickering（闪烁）at the corner of their field of perception. We know very little about the brain and how it deals with simultaneous conflicting input, but every common-sense intuition suggests we should be profoundly alarmed. This violation of concentration, silence, solitude（独处的状态）goes to the very heart of our notion of literacy; this new form of part-reading, of part-perception against background distraction, renders impossible certain essential acts of apprehension and concentration, let alone that most important tribute any human being can pay to a poem or a piece of prose he or she really loves, which is to learn it by heart. Not by brain, by heart; the expression is vital.	Under these circumstances, the question of what future there is for the arts of reading is a real one. Ahead of us lie technical, psychic（心理的）, and social transformations probably much more dramatic than those brought about by Gutenberg, the German inventor in printing. The Gutenberg revolution, as we now know it, took a long time; its effects are still being debated. The information revolution will touch every facet of composition, publication, distribution, and reading. No one in the book industry can say with any confidence what will happen to the book, as we’ve known it.31.	The picture of the reading ability of the American people, drawn by the author, is _____.	A) rather bleak	B) fairly bright	C) very impressive	D) quite encouraging32.	The author’s biggest concern is ____________.

A major problem with most adolescents who can read is ___________.	A) their fondness of music and TV programs	B) their ignorance of various forms of art and literature	C) their lack of attentiveness and basic understanding	D) their inability to focus on conflicting input34.	The author claims that the best way a reader can show admiration for a piece of poetry or prose is ____________.	A) to be able to appreciate it and memorize it	B) to analyze its essential features	C) to think it over conscientiously	D) to make a fair appraisal of its artistic value35.	About the future of the arts of reading the author feels ____________.	A) upset	B) uncertain	C) alarmed	D) pessimisticPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:	For centuries, explorers have risked their lives venturing into the unknown for reasons that were to varying degrees economic and nationalistic.  went west to look for better trade routes to the Orient and to promote the greater glory of . Lewis and Clark journeyed into the American wilderness to find out what the  had acquired when it purchased , and the Appolo astronauts rocketed to the moon in a dramatic show of technological muscle during the cold war.	Although their missions blended commercial and political-military imperatives, the explorers involved all accomplished some significant science simply by going where no scientists had gone before.	Today Mars looms（隐约出现）as humanity’s next great terra incognita（未探明之地）. And with doubtful prospects for a short-term financial return, with the cold war a rapidly fading memory and amid a growing emphasis on international cooperation in large space ventures, it is clear that imperatives other than profits or nationalism will have to compel human beings to leave their tracks on the planet’s reddish surface. Could it be that science, which has long played a minor role in exploration, is at last destined to take a leading role? The question naturally invites a couple of others: Are there experiments that only humans could do on Mars? Could those experiments provide insights profound enough to justify the expense of sending people across interplanetary space?	With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been. The issue of whether life ever existed on the planet, and whether it persists to this day, has been highlighted by mounting evidence that the Red Planet once had abundant stable, liquid water and by the continuing controversy over suggestions that bacterial fossils rode to Earth on a meteorite（陨石）from Mars. A more conclusive answer about life on Mars, past or present, would give researchers invaluable data about the range of conditions under which a planet can generate the complex chemistry that leads to life. If it could be established that life arose independently on Mars and Earth, the finding would provide the first concrete clues in one of the deepest mysteries in all of science: the prevalence of life in the universe.36.	According to the passage, the chief purpose of explorers in going to unknown places in the past was ______________.	A) to display their country’s military might	B) to accomplish some significant science	C) to find new areas for colonization	D) to pursue commercial and state interests37.	At present, a probable inducement for countries to initiate large-scale space ventures is _____________.	A) international cooperation	B) nationalistic reasons	C) scientific research	D) long-term profits38.	What is the main goal of sending human missions to Mars?	A) To find out if life ever existed there.	B) To see if humans could survive there.	C) To prove the feasibility of large-scale space ventures.	D) To show the leading role of science in space exploration.39.	By saying “With Mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been” (Line 1, Para.4), the author means that _________________.	A) with Mars the risks involved are much greater than any previous space ventures	B) in the case of Mars, the rewards of scientific exploration can be very high	C) in the case of Mars, much more research funds are needed than ever before	D) with Mars, scientists argue, the fundamental interests of science are at issue40.	The passage tells us that proof of life on Mars would _______________.	A) make clear the complex chemistry in the development of life	B) confirm the suggestion that bacterial fossils traveled to Earth on a meteorite	C) reveal the kind of conditions under which life originates	D) provide an explanation why life is common in the universePart III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:	Navigation computers, now sold by most car-makers, cost $2,000 and up. No surprise, then, that they are most often found in luxury cars, like Lexus, BMW and Audi. But it is a developing technology — meaning prices should eventually drop — and the market does seem to be growing.	Even at current prices, a navigation computer is impressive. It can guide you from point to point in most major cities with precise turn-by-turn directions — spoken by a clear human- sounding voice, and written on a screen in front of the driver.	The computer works with an antenna (天线) that takes signals from no fewer than three of the 24 global positioning system (GPS) satellites. By measuring the time required for a signal to travel between the satellites and the antenna, the car’s location can be pinned down within 100 meters.	The satellite signals, along with inputs on speed from a wheel-speed sensor and direction from a meter, determine the car’s position even as it moves. This information is combined with a map database. Streets, landmarks and points of interest are included.	Most systems are basically identical. The differences come in hardware — the way the computer accepts the driver’s request for directions and the way it presents the driving instructions. On most systems, a driver enters a desired address, motorway junction or point of interest via a touch screen or disc. But the Lexus screen goes a step further: you can point to any spot on the map screen and get directions to it.	BMW’s system offers a set of cross hairs (瞄准器上的十字纹) that can be moved across the map (you have several choices of map scale) to pick a point you’d like to get to. Audi’s screen can be switched to TV reception.	Even the voices that recite the directions can differ, with better systems like BMW’s and Lexus’s having a wider vocabulary. The instructions are available in French, German, Spanish, Dutch and Italian, as well as English. The driver can also choose parameters for determining the route: fastest, shortest or no freeways (高速公路), for example.21.	We learn from the passage that navigation computers ________.	A) will greatly promote sales of automobiles	B) may help solve potential traffic problems	C) are likely to be accepted by more drivers	D) wills soon be viewed as a symbol of luxury22.	With a navigation computer, a driver will easily find the best route to his destination ________.	A) by inputting the exact address	B) by indicating the location of his car	C) by checking his computer database	D) by giving vocal orders to the computer23.	Despite their varied designs, navigation computers used in cars ________.	A) are more or less the same price	B) provide directions in much the same way	C) work on more or less the same principles	D) receive instructions from the same satellites24.	The navigation computer functions ________.	A) by means of a direction finder and a speed detector	B) basically on satellite signals and a map database	C) mainly through the reception of turn-by-turn directions	D) by using a screen to display satellite signals25.	The navigation systems in cars like Lexus, BMW and Audi are mentioned to show ________.	A) the immaturity of the new technology	B) the superiority of the global positioning system	C) the cause of price fluctuations in car equipment	D) the different ways of providing guidance to the driverPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	“The world’s environment is surprisingly healthy. Discuss.” If that were an examination topic, most students would tear it apart, offering a long list of complaints: from local smog (烟雾) to global climate change, from the felling (砍伐) of forests to the extinction of species. The list would largely be accurate, the concern legitimate. Yet the students who should be given the highest marks would actually be those who agreed with the statement. The surprise is how good things are, not how bad.	After all, the world’s population has more than tripled during this century, and world output has risen hugely, so you would expect the earth itself to have been affected. Indeed, if people lived, consumed and produced things in the same way as they did in 1900 (or 1950, or indeed 1980), the world by now would be a pretty disgusting place: smelly, dirty, toxic and dangerous.	But they don’t. The reasons why they don’t, and why the environment has not been ruined, have to do with prices, technological innovation, social change and government regulation in response to popular pressure. That is why today’s environmental problems in the poor countries ought, in principle, to be solvable.	Raw materials have not run out, and show no sign of doing so. Logically, one day they must: the planet is a finite place. Yet it is also very big, and man is very ingenious. What has happened is that every time a material seems to be running short, the price has risen and, in response, people have looked for new sources of supply, tried to find ways to use less of the material, or looked for a new substitute. For this reason prices for energy and for minerals have fallen in real terms during the century. The same is true for food. Prices fluctuate, in response to harvests, natural disasters and political instability; and when they rise, it takes some time before new sources of supply become available. But they always do, assisted by new farming and crop technology. The long- term trend has been downwards.	It is where prices and markets do not operate properly that this benign (良性的) trend begins to stumble, and the genuine problems arise. Markets cannot always keep the environment healthy. If no one owns the resource concerned, no one has an interest in conserving it or fostering it: fish is the best example of this.26.	According to the author, most students ________.	A) believe the world’s environment is in an undesirable condition	B) agree that the environment of the world is not as bad as it is thought to be	C) get high marks for their good knowledge of the world’s environment	D) appear somewhat unconcerned about the state of the world’s environment27.	The huge increase in world production and population ________.	A) has made the world a worse place to live in	B) has had a positive influence on the environment	C) has not significantly affected the environment	D) has made the world a dangerous place to live in28.	One of the reasons why the long-term trend of prices has been downwards is that ________.	A) technological innovation can promote social stability	B) political instability will cause consumption to drop	C) new farming and crop technology can lead to overproduction	D) new sources are always becoming available29.	Fish resources are diminishing because ________.	A) no new substitutes can be found in large quantities	B) they are not owned by any particular entity	C) improper methods of fishing have ruined the fishing grounds	D) water pollution is extremely serious30.	The primary solution to environmental problems is ________.	A) to allow market forces to operate properly	B) to curb consumption of natural resources	C) to limit the growth of the world population	D) to avoid fluctuations in pricesPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	About the time that schools and others quite reasonably became interested in seeing to it that all children, whatever their background, were fairly treated, intelligence testing became unpopular.	Some thought it was unfair to minority children. Through the past few decades such testing has gone out of fashion and many communities have indeed forbidden it.	However, paradoxically, just recently a group of black parents filed a lawsuit (诉讼) in California claiming that the state’s ban on IQ testing discriminates against their children by denying them the opportunity to take the test. (They believed, correctly, that IQ tests are a valid method of evaluating children for special education classes.) The judge, therefore, reversed, at least partially, his original decision.	And so the argument goes on and on. Does it benefit or harm children from minority groups to have their intelligence tested? We have always been on the side of permitting, even facilitating, such testing. If a child of any color or group is doing poorly in school it seems to us very important to know whether it is because he or she is of low intelligence, or whether some other factor is the cause.	What school and family can do to improve poor performance is influenced by its cause. It is not discriminative to evaluate either a child’s physical condition or his intellectual level.	Unfortunately, intellectual level seems to be a sensitive subject, and what the law allows us to do varies from time to time. The same fluctuation back and forth occurs in areas other than intelligence. Thirty years or so ago, for instance, white families were encouraged to adopt black children. It was considered discriminative not to do so.	And then the style changed and this cross-racial adopting became generally unpopular, and social agencies felt that black children should go to black families only. It is hard to say what are the best procedures. But surely good will on the part of all of us is needed.	As to intelligence, in our opinion, the more we know about any child’s intellectual level, the better for the child in question.31.	Why did the intelligence test become unpopular in the past few decades?	A) Its validity was challenged by many communities.	B) It was considered discriminative against minority children.	C) It met with strong opposition from the majority of black parents.	D) It deprived the black children of their rights to a good education.32.	The recent legal action taken by some black parents in  aimed to ________.	A) draw public attention to IQ testing	B) put an end to special education	C) remove the state’s ban on intelligence tests	D) have their children enter white schools33.	The author believes that intelligence testing ________.	A) may ease racial confrontation in the 	B) can encourage black children to keep up with white children	C) may seriously aggravate racial discrimination in the 	D) can help black parents make decisions abut their children’s education34.	The author’s opinion of child adoption seems to be that ________.	A) no rules whatsoever can be prescribed	B) white families should adopt black children	C) adoption should be based on IQ test results	D) cross-racial adoption is to be advocated35.	Child adoption is mentioned in the passage to show that ________.	A) good will may sometimes complicate racial problems	B) social surroundings are vital to the healthy growth of children	C) intelligence testing also applies to non-academic areas	D) American opinion can shift when it comes to sensitive issuesPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:	Not too many decades ago it seemed “obvious” both to the general public and to sociologists that modern society has changed people’s natural relations, loosened their responsibilities to kin (亲戚) and neighbors, and substituted in their place superficial relationships with passing acquaintances. However, in recent years a growing body of research has revealed that the “obvious” is not true. It seems that if you are a city resident, you typically know a smaller proportion of your neighbors than you do if you are a resident of a smaller community. But, for the most part, this fact has few significant consequences. It does not necessarily follow that if you know few of your neighbors you will know no one else.	Even in very large cities, people maintain close social ties within small, private social worlds. Indeed, the number and quality of meaningful relationships do not differ between more and less urban people. Small-town residents are more involved with kin than are big-city residents. Yet city dwellers compensate by developing friendships with people who share similar interests and activities. Urbanism may produce a different style of life, but the quality of life does not differ between town and city. Nor are residents of large communities any likelier to display psychological symptoms of stress or alienation, a feeling of not belonging, than are residents of smaller communities. However, city dwellers do worry more about crime, and this leads them to a distrust of strangers.	These findings do not imply that urbanism makes little or no difference. If neighbors are strangers to one another, they are less likely to sweep the sidewalk of an elderly couple living next door or keep an eye out for young trouble makers. Moreover, as Wirth suggested, there may be a link between a community’s population size and its social heterogeneity (多样性). For instance, sociologists have found much evidence that the size of a community is associated with bad behavior including gambling, drugs, etc. Large-city urbanites are also more likely than their small-town counterparts to have a cosmopolitan (见多识广者的) outlook, to display less responsibility to traditional kinship roles, to vote for leftist political candidates, and to be tolerant of nontraditional religious groups, unpopular political groups, and so-called undesirables. Everything considered, heterogeneity and unusual behavior seem to be outcomes of large population size.36.	Which of the following statements best describes the organization of the first paragraph?	A) Two contrasting views are presented.	B) An argument is examined and possible solutions given.C) Research results concerning the quality of urban life are presented in order of time.D) A detailed description of the difference between urban and small-town life is given.37.	According to the passage, it was once a common belief that urban residents ________.	A) did not have the same interests as their neighbors	B) could not develop long-standing relationships	C) tended to be associated with bad behavior	D) usually had more friends38.	One of the consequences of urban life is that impersonal relationships among neighbors ________.	A) disrupt people’s natural relations	B) make them worry about crime	C) cause them not to show concern for one another	D) cause them to be suspicious of each other39.	It can be inferred from the passage that the bigger a community is, ________.	A) the better its quality of life	B) the more similar its interests	C) the more tolerant and open-minded it is	D) the likelier it is to display psychological symptoms of stress40.	What is the passage mainly about?	A) Similarities in the interpersonal relationships between urbanites and small-town dwellers.	B) Advantages of living in big cities as compared with living in small town.	C) The positive role that urbanism plays in modern life.	D) The strong feeling of alienation of city inhabitants.Part III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B) C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage:	When global warming finally came, it stuck with a vengeance (异乎寻常地). In some regions, temperatures rose several degrees in less than a century. Sea levels shot up nearly 400 feet, flooding coastal settlements and forcing people to migrate inland. Deserts spread throughout the world as vegetation shifted drastically in North America, Europe and . After driving many of the animals around them to near extinction, people were forced to abandon their old way of life for a radically new survival strategy that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. The adaptation was farming: the global-warming crisis hat gave rise to it happened more than 10,000 years ago.	As environmentalists convene in Rio de Janeiro this week to ponder the global climate of the future, earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in understanding how climate has changed in the past — and how those changes have transformed human existence. Researchers have begun to piece together an illuminating picture of the powerful geological and astronomical forces that have combined to change the planet’s environment from hot to cold, wet to dry and back again over a time period stretching back hundreds of millions of years.	Most important, scientists are beginning to realize that the climatic changes have had a major impact on the evolution of the human species. New research now suggests that climate shifts have played a key role in nearly every significant turning point in human evolution: from the dawn of primates (灵长目动物) some 65 million years ago to human ancestors rising up to walk on two legs, from the huge expansion of the human brain to the rise of agriculture. Indeed, the human history has not been merely touched by global climate change, some scientists argue, it has in some instances been driven by it.	The new research has profound implications for the environmental summit in . Among other things, the findings demonstrate that dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The benign (宜人的) global environment that has existed over the past 10,000 years — during which agriculture, writing, cities and most other features of civilization appeared — is a mere bright spot in a much larger pattern of widely varying climate over the ages. In fact, the pattern of climate change in the past reveals that Earth’s climate will almost certainly go through dramatic changes in the future — even without the influence of human activity.21.	Farming emerged as a survival strategy because man had been obliged ______.	A) to give up his former way of life	B) to leave the coastal areas	C) to follow the ever-shifting vegetation	D) to abandon his original settlement22.	Earth scientists have come to understand that climate ______.	A) is going through a fundamental change	B) has been getting warmer for 10,000 years	C) will eventually change from hot to cold	D) has gone through periodical changes23.	Scientists believe that human evolution ______.	A) has seldom been accompanied by climatic changes	B) has exerted little influence on climatic changes	C) has largely been effected by climatic changes	D) has had a major impact on climatic changes24.	Evidence of past climatic changes indicates that ______.	A) human activities have accelerated changes of Earth’s environment	B) Earth’s environment will remain mild despite human interference	C) Earth’s climate is bound to change significantly in the future	D) Earth’s climate is unlikely to undergo substantial changes in the future25.	The message the author wishes to convey in the passage is that ______.	A) human civilization remains glorious though it is affected by climatic changes	B) mankind is virtually helpless in the face of the dramatic changes of climate	C) man has to limit his activities to slow down the global warming process	D) human civilization will continue to develop in spite of the changes of naturePassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	No woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to the late Duchess (公爵夫人) of Windsor embodies much of the odd spirit of our times. Being thin is deemed as such a virtue.	The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better — or worse — part of my life. Being rich wouldn’t be bad either, but that won’t happen unless an unknown relative dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars.	Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin, and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not repellent? All religions have certain days when people refrain from eating and excessive eating is one of Christianity’s seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable salvation and high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being.	Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat — or even only somewhat overweight — is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength.	Our obsession (迷恋) with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that, in many cases, being over-weight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, many have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem — too much fat and a lack of fiber — than a weight problem.	The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much attention to weight. Simply being thin is not enough. It is actually hazardous if those who get (or already are) thin think they are automatically healthy and thus free form paying attention to their overall life-style. Thinness can be pure vainglory (虚荣).26.	In the eyes of the author, an odd phenomenon nowadays is that ______.	A) the Duchess of  is regarded as a woman of virtue.	B) looking slim is a symbol of having a large fortune	C) being thin is viewed as a much desired quality	D) religious people are not necessarily virtuous27.	Swept by the prevailing trend, the author ______.	A) had to go on a diet for the greater part of her life	B) could still prevent herself from going off the track	C) had to seek help from rich distant relatives	D) had to wear highly fashionable clothes28.	In human history, people’s views on body weight ______.	A) were closely related to their religious beliefs	B) changed from time to time	C) varied between the poor and the rich	D) led to different oral standards29.	The author criticizes women’s obsession with thinness ______.	A) from an economic and educational perspective	B) from sociological and medical points of view	C) from a historical and religious standpoint	D) in the light of moral principles30.	What’s the author’s advice to women who are absorbed in the idea of thinness?	A) They should be more concerned with their overall lifestyle.	B) They should be more watchful for fatal diseases.	C) They should gain weight to look healthy.	D) They should rid themselves of fantasies about designer clothes.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	War may be a natural expression of biological instincts and drives toward aggression in the human species. Natural impulses of anger, hostility, and territoriality (守卫地盘的天性) are expressed through acts of violence. Theses are all qualities that humans share with animals. Aggression is a kind of innate (天生的) survival mechanism, an instinct for self-preservation, that allows animals to defend themselves from threats to their existence. But, on the other hand, human violence shows evidence of being a learned behavior. In the case of human aggression, violence cannot be simply reduced to an instinct. The many expressions of human violence are always conditioned by social conventions that give shape to aggressive behavior. In human societies violence has a social function: It is a strategy for creating or destroying forms of social order. Religious traditions have taken a leading role in directing the powers of violence. We will look at the ritual and ethical (道德上的) patterns within which human violence has been directed.	The violence within a society is controlled through institutions of law. The more developed a legal system becomes, the more society takes responsibility for the discovery, control, and punishment of violent acts. In most tribal societies the only means to deal with an act of violence is revenge. Each family group may have the responsibility for personally carrying out judgment and punishment upon the person who committed the offense. But in legal systems, the responsibility for revenge becomes depersonalized and diffused. The society assumes the responsibility for protecting individuals from violence. In cases where they cannot be protected, the society is responsible for imposing punishment. In a sate controlled legal system, individuals are removed from the cycle of revenge motivated by acts of violence, and the state assumes responsibility for their protection.	The other side of a state legal apparatus is a state military apparatus. While the one protects the individual from violence, the other sacrifices the individual to violence in the interests of the state. In war the state affirms its supreme power over the individuals within its own borders. War is not simply a trial by combat to settle disputes between states; it is the moment when the state makes its most powerful demands upon its people for their recommitment, allegiance, and supreme sacrifice. Times of war test a community’s deepest religious and ethical commitments.31.	Human violence shows evidence of being a learned behavior in that ______.	A) it threatens the existing social systems	B) it is influenced by society	C) it has roots in religious conflicts	D) it is directed against institutions of law32.	The function of legal systems, according to the passage, is ______.	A) to control violence within a society	B) to protect the world from chaos	C) to free society from the idea of revenge	D) to give the government absolute power33.	What does the author mean by saying “… in legal systems, the responsibility for revenge becomes depersonalized an diffused” (Lines 5-6, Para. 2)	A) Legal systems greatly reduce the possibilities of physical violence.	B) Offenses against individuals are no longer judged on a personal basis.	C) Victims of violence find it more difficult to take revenge.	D) Punishment is not carried out directly by the individuals involved.34.	The word “allegiance” (Line 5, Para. 3) is closest in meaning to ______.	A) loyalty	B) objective	C) survival	D) motive35.	What can we learn from the last paragraph?	A) Governments tend to abuse their supreme power in times of war.	B) In times of war governments may extend their power across national borders.C) In times of war governments impose high religious and ethical standards on their people.	D) Governments may sacrifice individuals in the interests of the state in times of war.Passage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:	Researchers who are unfamiliar with the cultural and ethnic groups they are studying must take extra precautions to shed any biases they bring with them from their own culture. For example, they must make sure they construct measures that are meaningful for each of the cultural or ethnic minority groups being studied.	In conducting research on cultural and ethnic minority issues, investigators distinguish between the emic approach and the etic approach. In the emic approach, the goal is to describe behavior in one culture or ethnic group in terms that are meaningful and important to the people in that culture or ethnic group, without regard to other cultures or ethnic groups. In the etic approach, the goal is to describe behavior so that generalizations can be made across cultures. If researchers construct a questionnaire in an emic fashion, their concern is only that the questions are meaningful to the particular culture or ethnic group being studied. If, however, the researchers construct a questionnaire in an etic fashion, they want to include questions that reflect concepts familiar to all cultures involved.	How might the emic and etic approaches be reflected in the study of family processes? In the emic approach, the researchers might choose to focus only on middle-class White families, without regard for whether the information obtained in the study can be generalized or is appropriate for ethnic minority groups. In a subsequent study, the researchers may decide to adopt an etic approach by studying not only middle-class White families, but also lower-income White families, Black American families, Spanish American families, and Asian American families. In studying ethnic minority families, the researchers would likely discover that the extended family is more frequently a support system in ethnic minority families than in White American families. If so, the emic approach would reveal a different pattern of family interaction than would the etic approach, documenting that research with middle-class White families cannot always be generalized to all ethnic groups.36.	According to the first paragraph, researchers unfamiliar with the target cultures are inclined to ______.	A) be overcautious in constructing meaningful measures	B) view them from their own cultural perspective	C) guard against interference from their own culture	D) accept readily what is alien to their own cultureWhat does the author say about the emic approach and the etic approach?	A) They have different research focuses in the study of ethnic issues.	B) The former is biased while the latter is objective.	C) The former concentrates on the study of culture while the latter on family issues.	D) They are both heavily dependent on questionnaires in conducting surveys.38.	Compared with the etic approach, the emic approach is apparently more ______.	A) culturally interactive	B) culture-oriented	C) culturally biased	D) culture-specific39.	The etic approach is concerned with ______.	A) the general characteristics of minority families	B) culture-related concepts of individual ethnic groups	C) features shared by various cultures or ethnic groups	D) the economic conditions of different types of families40.	Which of the following is true of the ethnic minority families in the  according to the passage?	A) Their cultural patterns are usually more adaptable.	B) Their cultural concepts are difficult to comprehend.	C) They don’t interact with each other so much as White families.	D) They have closer family ties than White families.Part III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 3.0. incomplete sentences in this part.

Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft chairman without a single earned university degree, is by his success raising new doubts about the worth of the business world’s favorite academic title: the MBA (Master of Business Administration).	The MBA, a 20th-century product, always has borne the mark of lowly commerce and greed (贪婪) on the tree-lined campuses ruled by purer disciplines such as philosophy and literature.	But even with the recession apparently cutting into the hiring of business school graduates, about 79,000 people are expected to receive MBAs in 1993. This is nearly 16 times the number of business graduates in 1960, a testimony to the widespread assumption that the MBA is vital for young men and women who want to run companies some day.	“If you are going into the corporate world it is still a disadvantage not to have one,” said Donald Morrison, professor of marketing and management science. “But in the last five years or so, when someone says, ‘Should I attempt to get an MBA,’ the answer a lot more is: It depends.”	The success of Bill Gates and other non-MBAs, such as the late Sam Walton of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has helped inspire self-conscious debates on business school campuses over the worth of a business degree and whether management skills can be taught.	The Harvard Business Review printed a lively, fictional exchange of letters to dramatize complaints about business degree holders.	The article called MBA hires “extremely disappointing” and said “MBAs want to move up too fast, they don’t understand politics and people, and they aren’t able to function as part of a team until their third year. But by then, they’re out looking for other jobs.”	The problem, most participants in the debate acknowledge, is that the MBA has acquired an aura (光环) of future riches and power far beyond its actual importance and usefulness.	Enrollment in business schools exploded in the 1970s and 1980s and created the assumption that no one who pursued a business career could do without one. The growth was fueled by a backlash (反冲) against the anti-business values of the 1960s and by the women’s movement.	Business people who have hired or worked with MBAs say those with the degrees often know how to analyze systems but are not so skillful at motivating people. “They don’t get a lot of grounding in the people side of the business,” said James Shaffer, vice-president and principal of the Towers Perrin management consulting firm.21.	According to Paragraph 2, what is the general attitude towards business on campuses dominated by purer disciplines?	A) Scornful	C) Envious.	B) Appreciative.	D) Realistic.22.	It seems that the controversy over the value of MBA degrees has been fueled mainly by ______.	A) the complaints from various employers	B) the success of many non-MBAs	C) the criticism from the scientists of purer disciplines	D) the poor performance of MBAs at work23.	What is the major weakness of MBA holders according to The Harvard Business Review?	A) They are usually serf-centered.	B) They are aggressive and greedy.	C) They keep complaining about their jobs.	D) They are not good at dealing with people.24.	From the passage we know that most MBAs _______.	A) can climb the corporate ladder fairly quickly	B) quit their jobs once they are familiar with their workmates	C) receive salaries that do not match their professional training	D) cherish unrealistic expectations about their future25.	What is the passage mainly about?	A) Why there is an increased enrollment in MBA programs.	B) The necessity of reforming MBA programs in business schools.	C) Doubts about the worth of holding an MBA degree.	D) A debate held recently on university campuses.Passage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.	When school officials in Kalkaska, Michigan, closed classes last week, the media flocked to the story, portraying the town’s 2,305 students as victims of stingy (吝啬的) taxpayers. There is some truth to that; the property-tax rate here is one-third lower than the state average. But shutting their schools also allowed Kalkaska’s educators and the state’s largest teachers’ union, the Michigan Education Association, to make a political point. Their aim was to spur passage of legislation  lawmakers are debating to increase the state’s share of school funding.	It was no coincidence that Kalkaska shut its schools two weeks after residents rejected a 28 percent property-tax increase. The school board argued that without the increase it lacked the $1.5 million needed to keep schools open.	But the school system had not done all it could to keep the schools open. Officials declined to borrow against next year’s state aid, they refused to trim extracurricular activities and they did not consider seeking a smaller—perhaps more acceptable—tax increase. In fact, closing early is costing Kalkaska a significant amount, including $ unemployment payments to teachers and staff and $ lost state aid. In February, the school system promised teachers and staff two months of retirement payments in case schools closed early, a deal that will cost the district $275,000 more.	Other signs suggest school authorities were at least as eager to make a political statement as to keep schools open. The Michigan Education Association hired a public relations firm to stage a rally marking the school closings, which attracted 14 local and national television stations and networks. The president of the National Education Association, the MEA’s parent organization, flew from Washington, D. C., for the event. And the union tutored school officials in the art of television interviews. School supervisor Doyle Disbrow acknowledges the district could have kept schools open by cutting programs but denies the moves were politically motivated.	 lawmakers have reacted angrily to the closings. The state Senate has already voted to put the system into receivership (破产管理) and reopen schools immediately; the Michigan House plans to consider the bill this week.26.	We learn from the passage that schools in , are funded ______.	A) by both the local and state governments	B) exclusively by the local government	C) mainly by the state government	D) by the National Education Association27.	One of the purposes for which school officials closed classes was _______.	A) to avoid paying retirement benefits to teachers and staff	B) to draw the attention of local taxpayers to political issues	C) to make the financial difficulties of their teachers and staff known to the public	D) to pressure  lawmakers into increasing state funds for local schools28.	The author seems to disapprove of _______.	A) the  lawmakers’ endless debating	B) the shutting of schools in Kalkaska	C) the involvement of the mass media	D) delaying the passage of the school funding legislation29.	We learn from the passage that school authorities in Kalkaska are more concerned about _______.	A) a raise in the property-tax rate in 	B) reopening the schools there immediately	C) the attitude of the MEA’s parent organization	D) making a political issue of the closing of the schools30.	According to the passage, the closing of the schools developed into a crisis because of ______.	A) the complexity of the problem	B) the political motives on the part of the educators	C) the weak response of the state officials	D) the strong protest on the part of the students’ parentsPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.	German Chancellor (首相) Otto Von Bismarck may be most famous for his military and diplomatic talent, but his legacy (遗产) includes many of today’s social insurance programs. During the middle of the 19th century, , along with other European nations, experienced an unprecedented rash of workplace deaths and accidents as a result of growing industrialization. Motivated in part by Christian compassion (怜悯) for the helpless as well as a practical political impulse to undercut the support of the socialist labor movement, Chancellor Bismarck created the world’s first workers’ compensation law in 1884.	By 1908, the  was the only industrial nation in the world that lacked workers’ compensation insurance. ’s injured workers could sue for damages in a court of law, but they still faced a number of tough legal barriers. For example, employees had to prove that their injuries directly resulted from employer negligence and that they themselves were ignorant about potential hazards in the workplace. The first state workers’ compensation law in this country passed in 1911, and the program soon spread throughout the nation.	After World War II, benefit payments to American workers did not keep up with the cost of living. In fact, real benefit levels were lower in the 1970s than they were in the 1940s, and in most states the maximum benefit was below the poverty level for a family of four. In 1970, President Richard Nixon set up a national commission to study the problems of workers’ compensation. Two years later, the commission issued 19 key recommendations, including one that called for increasing compensation benefit levels to 100 percent of the states’ average weekly wages.	In fact, the average compensation benefit in  has climbed from 55 percent of the states’ average weekly wages in 1972 to 97 percent today. But, as most studies show, every 10 percent increase in compensation benefits results in a 5 percent increase in the numbers of workers who file for claims. And with so much more money floating in the workers’ compensation system, it’s not surprising that doctors and lawyers have helped themselves to a large slice of the growing pie.31.	The world’s first workers’ compensation law was introduced by  _______.	A) to make industrial production safer	B) to speed up the pace of industrialization	C) out of religious and political considerations	D) for fear of losing the support of the socialist labor movement32.	We learn from the passage that the process of industrialization in  _______.	A) was accompanied by an increased number of workshop accidents	B) resulted in the development of popular social insurance programs	C) required workers to be aware of the potential dangers at the workplace	D) met growing resistance from laborers working at machines33.	One of the problems the American injured workers faced in getting compensation in the early 19th century was that ______.	A) they had to have the courage to sue for damages in a court of law	B) different sums in the  had totally different compensation programs	C) America’s average compensation benefit was much lower than the cost of livingD) they had to produce evidence that their employers were responsible for the accident34.	After 1972 workers’ compensation insurance in the  became more favorable to workers so that _______.	A) the poverty level for a family of four went up drastically	B) there were fewer legal barriers when they filed for claims	C) the number of workers suing for damages increased	D) more money was allocated to their compensation system35.	The author ends the passage with the implication that ______.	A) compensation benefits in  are soaring to new heights	B) the workers are not the only ones to benefit from the compensation system	C) people from all walks of life can benefit from the compensation system	D) money floating in the compensation system is a huge drain on the  economyPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.	Early in the age of affluence (富裕) that followed World War II, an American retailing analyst named Victor Lebow proclaimed, “Our enormously productive economy ... demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. ... We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever increasing rate.”	Americans have responded to Lebow’s call, and much of the world has followed.	Consumption has become a central pillar of life in industrial lands and is even embedded in social values. Opinion surveys in the world’s two largest economies—Japan and the United Sates—show consumerist definitions of success becoming ever more prevalent.	Overconsumption by the world’s fortunate is an environmental problem unmatched in severity by anything but perhaps population growth. Their surging exploitation of resources threatens to exhaust or unalterably spoil forests, soils, water, air and climate.	Ironically, high consumption may be a mixed blessing in human terms, too. The time-honored values of integrity of character, good work, friendship, family and community have often been sacrificed in the rush to riches.	Thus many in the industrial lands have a sense that their world of plenty is somehow hollow—that, misled by a consumerist culture, they have been fruitlessly attempting to satisfy what are essentially social, psychological and spiritual needs with material things.	Of course, the opposite of overconsumption—poverty—is no solution to either environmental or human problems. It is infinitely worse for people and bad for the natural world too. Dispossessed (被剥夺得一无所有的) peasants slash-and-burn their way into the rain forests of Latin America, and hungry nomads (游牧民族) turn their herds out onto fragile African grassland, reducing it to desert.	If environmental destruction results when people have either too little or too much, we are left to wonder how much is enough. What level of consumption can the earth support? When does having more cease to add noticeably to human satisfaction?36.	The emergence of the affluent society after World War II ________.	A) gave birth to a new generation of upper class consumers	B) gave rise to the dominance of the new egoism	C) led to the reform of the retailing system	D) resulted in the worship of consumerism37.	Apart from enormous productivity, another important impetus to high consumption is _______.	A) the conversion of the sale of goods into rituals	B) the people’s desire for a rise in their living standards	C) the imbalance that has existed between production and consumption	D) the concept that one’s success is measured by how much they consume38.	Why does the author say high consumption is a mixed blessing?	A) Because poverty still exists in an affluent society.	B) Because moral values are sacrificed in pursuit of material satisfaction.	C) Because overconsumption won’t last long due to unrestricted population growth.	D) Because traditional rituals are often neglected in the process of modernization.39.	According to the passage, consumerist culture ________.	A) cannot thrive on a fragile economy	B) will not aggravate environmental problems	C) cannot satisfy human spiritual needs	D) will not alleviate poverty in wealthy countries40.	It can be inferred from the passage that _______.	A) human spiritual needs should match material affluence	B) there is never an end to satisfying people’s material needs	C) whether high consumption should be encouraged is still an issue	D) how to keep consumption at a reasonable level remains a problemPart III	Vocabulary and Structure	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

A new study by Dan Farmer, a gifted programmer, using an automated investigative program of his own called SATAN, shows that the owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors.	SATAN can try out a variety of well-known hacking (黑客的) tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in. Farmer has made the program publicly available, amid much criticism. A person with evil intent could use it to hunt down sites that are easy to burgle (闯入…行窃).	But Farmer is very concerned about the need to alert the public to poor security and, so far, events have proved him right. SATAN has done more to alert people to the risks than cause new disorder.	So is the Net becoming more secure? Far from it. In the early days, when you visited a Web site your browser simply looked at the content. Now the Web is full of tiny programs that automatically download when you look at a Web page, and run on your own machine. These programs could, if their authors wished, do all kinds of nasty things to your computer.	At the same time, the Net is increasingly populated with spiders, worms, agents and other types of automated beasts designed to penetrate the sites and seek out and classify information. All these make wonderful tools for antisocial people who want to invade weak sites and cause damage.	But let’s look on the bright side. Given the lack of locks, the Internet is surely the world’s biggest (almost) crime-free society. Maybe that is because hackers are fundamentally honest. Or that there currently isn’t much to steal. Or because vandalism (恶意破坏) isn’t much fun unless you have a peculiar dislike for someone.	Whatever the reason, let’s enjoy it while we can. But expect it all to change, and security to become the number one issue, when the most influential inhabitants of the Net are selling services they want to be paid for.21.	By saying “…owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors” (Line 3-4, Para.2), the author means that ______.	A) those happy times appear still to be with us	B) there simply wasn’t any crime to worry about	C) many sites are not well-protected	D) hackers try out tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in22.	SATAN, a program designed by Dan Farmer, can be used ______.	A) to investigate the security of Internet sites	B) to improve the security of the Internet system	C) to prevent hackers from breaking into websites	D) to download useful programs and information23.	Farmer’s program has been criticized by the public because ______.	A) it causes damage to Net browsers	B) it can break into Internet sites	C) it can be used to cause disorder on all sites	D) it can be used by people with evil intent24.	The author’s attitude toward SATAN is ______.	A) enthusiastic	B) critical	C) positive	D) indifferent25.	The author suggests in the last paragraph that ______.	A) we should make full use of the Internet before security measures are strengthened	B) we should alert the most influential businessmen to the importance of security	C) influential businessmen should give priority to the improvement of Net security	D) net inhabitants should not let security measures affect their joy of surfing the InternetPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage:	I came away from my years of teaching on tile college and university level with a conviction that enactment (扮演角色), performance, dramatization are the most successful forms of teaching. Students must be incorporated, made, so far as possible, an integral part of the learning process. The notion that learning should have in it an element of inspired play would seem to the greater part of the academic establishment merely silly, but that is nonetheless the case. Of Ezekiel Cheever, the most famous schoolmaster of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, his onetime student Cotton Mather wrote that he so planned his lessons that his pupils “came to work as though they came to play,” and Alfred North Whitehead, almost three hundred years later, noted that a teacher should make his/her students “glad they were there.”	Since, we are told, 80 to 90 percent of all instruction in the typical university is by the lecture method, we should give close attention to this form of education. There is, I think, much truth in Patricia Nelson Limerick’s observation that “lecturing is an unnatural act, an act for which God did not design humans. It is perfectly all right, now and then, for a human to be possessed by the urge to speak, and to speak while others remain silent. But to do this regularly, one hour and 15 minutes at a time… for one person to drag on while others sit in silence? ... I do not believe that this is what the Creator ... designed humans to do.”	The strange, almost incomprehensible fact is that many professors, just as they feel obliged to write dully, believe that they should lecture dully. To show enthusiasm is to risk appearing unscientific, unobjective; it is to appeal to the students’ emotions rather than their intellect. Thus the ideal lecture is one filled with facts and read in an unchanged monotone.	The cult (推崇) of lecturing dully, like the cult of writing dully, goes back, of course, some years. Edward Shils, professor of sociology, recalls the professors he encountered at the  in his youth. They seemed “a priesthood, rather uneven in their merits but uniform in their bearing; they never referred to anything personal. Some read from old lecture notes and then haltingly explained the thumb-worn last lines. Others lectured from cards that had served for years, to judge by the worn edges ....The teachers began on time, ended on time, and left the room without saying a word more to their students, very seldom being detained by questioners .... The classes were not large, yet there was no discussion. No questions were raised in class, and there were no office hours.”26.	The author believes that a successful teacher should be able to ______.	A) make dramatization an important aspect of students’ learning	B) make inspired play an integral part of the learning process	C) improve students’ learning performance	D) make study just as easy as play27.	The majority of university professors prefer the traditional way of lecturing in the belief that ______.	A) it draws the close attention of the students	B) it conforms in a way to the design of the Creator	C) it presents course content in a scientific and objective manner	D) it helps students to comprehend abstract theories more easily28.	What the author recommends in this passage is that ______.	A) college education should be improved through radical measures	B) more freedom of choice should be given to students in their studies	C) traditional college lectures should be replaced by dramatized performances	D) interaction should be encouraged in the process of teaching29.	By saying “They seemed ‘a priesthood, rather uneven in their merits but uniform in their bearing…’” (Lines 3-4, Para.4), the author means that ______.A) professors are a group of professionals that differ in their academic ability but behave in the same wayB) professors are like priests wearing the same kind of black gown but having different roles to playC) there is no fundamental difference between professors and priests though they differ in their meritsD) professors at the  used to wear black suits which made them look like priests30.	Whose teaching method is particularly commended by the author?	A) Ezekiel Cheever’s.	B) Alfred North Whitehead’s.	C) Cotton Mather’s.	D) Patricia Nelson Limerick’s.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage:	Take the case of public education alone. The principal difficulty faced by the schools has been the tremendous increase in the number of pupils. This has been caused by the advance of the legal age for going into industry and the impossibility of finding a job even when the legal age has been reached. In view of the technological improvements in the last few years, business will require in the future proportionately fewer workers than ever before. The result will be still further raising of the legal age for going into employment, and still further difficulty in finding employment when that age has been attained. If we cannot put our children to work, we must put them in school.	We may also be quite confident that the present trend toward a shorter day and a shorter week will be maintained. We have developed and shall continue to have a new leisure class. Already the public agencies for adult education are swamped by the tide that has swept over them since the depression began. They will be little better off when it is over. Their support must come from the taxpayer.	It is surely too much to hope that these increases in the cost of public education can be borne by the local communities. They cannot care for the present restricted and inadequate system. The local communities have failed in their efforts to cope with unemployment. They cannot expect to cope with public education on the scale on which we must attempt it. The answer to the problem of unemployment has been Federal relief. The answer to the problem of public education may have to be much the same, and properly so. If there is one thing in which the citizens of all parts of the country have an interest, it is in the decent education of the citizens of all parts of the country. Our income tax now goes in part to keep our neighbors alive. It may have to go in part as well to make our neighbors intelligent. We are now attempting to preserve the present generation through Federal relief of the destitute (贫民). Only a people determined to ruin the next generation will refuse such Federal funds as public education may require.31.	What is the passage mainly about?	A) How to persuade local communities to provide more funds.	B) How to cope with the shortage of funds for public education.	C) How to improve the public education system.	D) How to solve the rising unemployment problem.32.	What is the reason for the increase in the number of students?	A) The requirement of educated workers by business.	B) Raising of the legal age forgoing to work.	C) The trend toward a shorter workday.	D) People’s concern for the future of the next generation.33.	The public agencies for adult education will be little better off because ______.	A) the unemployed are too poor to continue their education	B) a new leisure class has developed	C) they are still suffering from the depression	D) an increase in taxes could be a problem34.	According to the author, the answer to the problem of public education is that the Federal government _______.	A) should allocate Federal funds for public education	B) should demand that local communities provide support	C) should raise taxes to meet the needs of public education	D) should first of all solve the problem of unemployment35.	Why does the author say “Only a people determined to ruin the next generation will refuse such Federal funds as public education may require” (Lines 10-11, Para. 3)?A) Only by appropriating adequate Federal funds for education can the next generation have a bright future.B) Citizens of all parts of the country agree that the best way to support education is to use Federal funds.C) People all over the country should make contributions to education in the interest of the next generation.	D) Educated people are determined to use part of the Federal funds to help the poor.Passage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage:	A new high-performance contact lens under development at the department for applied physics at the University of Heidelberg will not only correct ordinary vision defects but will enhance normal night vision as much as five times, making people’s vision sharper than that of cats.	Bille and his team work with an optical instrument called an active mirror — a device used in astronomical telescopes to spot newly emerging stars and far distant galaxies. Connected to a wave-front sensor that tracks and measures the course of a laser beam into the eye and back, the aluminum mirror detects the deficiencies of the cornea, the transparent protective layer covering the lens of the human eye. They highly precise data from the two instruments — which, Bille hopes, will one day be found at the opticians (眼镜商) all over the world — serve as a basis for the production of completely individualized contact lenses that correct and enhance the wearer’s vision.	By day, Bille’s contact lenses will focus rays of light so accurately on the retina (视网膜) that the image of a small leaf or the outline of a far distant tree will be formed with a sharpness that surpasses that of conventional vision aids by almost half a diopter (屈光度). At night, the lenses have an even greater potential. “Because the new lens — in contrast to the already existing ones — also works when it’s dark and the pupil is wide open,” says Bille, “lens wearers will be able to identify a face at distance of 100 meters — 80 meters farther than they would normally be able to see. In his experiments night vision was enhanced by an even greater factor: in semi-darkness, test subjects could see up to 15 times better than without the lenses.	Bille’s lenses are expected to reach the market in the year 2000, and one tentative plan is to use the Internet to transmit information on patients’ visual defects from the optician to the manufacturer, who will then produce and mail the contact lenses within a couple of days. The physicist expects the lenses to cost about a dollar a pair, about the same as conventional one-day disposable lenses.36.	The new contact lens is meant for ______.	A) astronomical observations	B) the night blind	C) those with vision defects	D) optical experiments37.	What do the two instruments mentioned in the second paragraph (Line 5) refer to?	A) The astronomical telescope and the wave-front sensor.	B) The aluminum mirror and the laser beam.	C) The active mirror and the contact lens.	D) The aluminum mirror and the wave-front sensor.38.	Individualized contact lenses (Line 7, Para.2) are lenses designed ______.	A) to work like an astronomical telescope	B) to suit the wearer’s specific needs	C) to process extremely accurate data	D) to test the wearer’s eyesight39.	According to Bille, with the new lenses the wearer’s vision ______.	A) will be far better at night than in the daytime	B) may be broadened about 15 times than without them	C) can be better improved in the daytime than at night	D) will be sharper by a much greater degree at night than in the daytime40.

Directions: There are 4 passages in this part, Each passage is followed by some questions at unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre. Passage One 
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage. 
     In 1985 when a Japan Air Lines (JAL) jet crashed, its president, Yasumoto Takagi, called each victim’s family to apologize, and then promptly resigned. And in 1987, when a subsidiary of Toshiba sole sensitive military technology to the former , the chairman of Toshiba gave up his post. 
    These executive actions, which Toshiba calls “the highest form of apology,” may seem bizarre to US managers. No one at Boeing resigned after the JAL crash, which may have been caused by a faulty Boeing repair. 
    The difference between the two business cultures centers around different definitions of delegation. While US executives give both responsibility and authority to their employees, Japanese executives delegate only authority—the responsibility is still theirs. Although the subsidiary that sold the sensitive technology to the Soviets had its own management, the Toshiba top executives said they “must take personal responsibility for not creating an atmosphere throughout the Toshiba group that would make such activity unthinkable, even in an independently run subsidiary.” 
    Such acceptance of community responsibility is not unique to businesses in . School principals in  have resigned when their students committed major crimes after school hours. Even if they do not quit, Japanese executives will often accept primary responsibility in other ways, such as taking the first pay cut when a company gets into financial trouble. Such personal sacrifices, even if they are largely symbolic, help to create the sense of community and employee loyalty that is crucial to the Japanese way of doing business. 
      Harvard Business School professor George Lodge calls the ritual acceptance of blame “almost a feudal (封建的) way of purging (清除) the community of dishonor,” and to some in the United States, such resignations look cowardly. However, in an era in which both business and governmental leaders seem particularly good at evading responsibility, many US managers would probably welcome an infusion (灌输) of the Japanese sense of responsibility, If, for instance, US automobile company executives offered to reduce their own salaries before they asked their workers to take pay cuts, negotiations would probably take on a very different character. 21. Why did the chairman of Toshiba resign his position in 1987? 
A) In , the leakage of a slate secret to Russians is a grave came. 
B) He had been under attack for shifting responsibility to his subordinates. 
C) In , the chief executive of a corporation is held responsible for the mistake made by its subsidiaries. 
D) He had been accused of being cowardly towards crises that were taking place in his corporation. 22. According to the passage if you want to be a good manager in , you have to ________. 
A) apologize promptly for your subordinates' mistakes 
B) be skillful in accepting blames from customers 
C) make symbolic sacrifices whenever necessary 
D) create a strong sense of company loyalty 23. What’s Professor George Lodge’s attitude towards the resignations of Japanese corporate leaders? 
A) Sympathetic                    C) Critical 
B) Biased.                         D) Approving. 24. Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A) Boeing had nothing to do with the JAL air crash in 1985. 
B) American executives consider authority and responsibility inseparable. 
C) School principals bear legal responsibility for students' crimes.

D) the difference between two business cultures Passage Two 
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage. 
    As machines go, the car is not terribly noisy, nor terribly polluting, nor terribly dangerous; and on all those dimensions it has become better as the century has grown older. The main problem is its prevalence, and the social costs that ensue from the use by everyone of something that would be fairly harmless if, say, only the rich were to use it. It is a price we pay for equality. 
   Before becoming too gloomy, it is worth recalling why the car has been arguably the most successful and popular product of the whole of the past 100 years—and remains so. The story begins with the environmental improvement it brought in the 1900s. In  in 1900, according to the Car Culture. A 1975 book by J. Flink, a historian, horses deposited 2.5 millioo pounds of manure(粪)and 60,000 gallons of urine (尿) every day. Every year, the city authorities had to remove an average of 15,000 dead horses from the streets, It made cars smell of roses. 
    Cars were also wonderfully flexible. The main earlier solution to horse pollution and traffic jams was the electric trolley bus (电车). But that required fixed overhead wires, and rails and platforms, which were expensive, ugly, and inflexible, The car could go from any A to any B, and allowed towns to develop in all directions with low-density housing, rather than just being concentrated along the trolley or rail lines. Rural areas benefited too, for they became less remote. 
    However, since pollution became a concern in the 1950s, experts have predicted—wrongly—that the car boom was about to end. In his book Mr. Flink argued that by 1973 the American market had become saturated, at one car for every 2.25 people, and so had the markets of  and  (because of land shortages). Environmental worries and diminishing oil reserves would prohibit mass car use anywhere else. 
    He was wrong, Between 1970 and 1990, whereas ’s population grew by 23%, the aumber of cars on its roads grew by 60%, There is now one car for every 1.7 people there, one for every  , one for every  . Around 550 million cars are already on the roads, not to mention all the trucks and mocorcyeles, and about 50 million new ones are made each year worldwide. Will it go on? Undoubtedly, because people want it to. 26. As is given in the first paragraph, the reason why the car has become a problem is that ________. 
A) poor people can’t afford it 
B) it is too expensive to maintain 
C) too many people are using it 
D) it causes too many road accidents 27. According to the passage, the car started to gain popularity because ________. 
A) it didn’t break down as easily as a horse 
B) it had a comparatively pleasant odor 
C) it caused less pollution than horses 
D) it brightened up the gloomy streets 28. What impact did the use of cars have on society? 
A) People were compelled to leave downtown areas. 
B) People were able to live in less crowded suburban areas. 
C) Business along trolley and rail lines slackened. 
D) City streets were free of ugly overhead wires. 29. Mr.Flink argued in his book that cars would not be widely used in other countries because ________. 
A) the once booming car market has become saturated 
B) traffic jams in those countries are getting more and more serious 
C) expensive motorways are not available in less developed countries 
D) people worry about pollution and the diminishing oil resources 30. What’s wrong with Mr.Flink’s prediction? 
A) The use of automobiles has kept increasing worldwide. 
B) New generations of cars are virtually pollution free. 
C) The population of  has not increased as fast. 
D) People’s environmental concerns are constantly increasing. 
Passage Three 
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage. 
     Crying is hardly an activity encouraged by society. Tears, be they of sorrow, anger, on joy, typically make Americans feel uncomforuble and embarrassed. The shedder of tears is likely to apologize, even when a devastating (毁灭性的) tragedy was the provocation. The observer of tears is likely to do everything possible to put an end to the emotional outpouring. But judging form recent studies of crying behavior, links between illness and crying and the chemical composition of tears, both those responses to tears are often inappropriate and may even be counterproductive. 
     Humans are the only animals definitely known to shed emotiomal tears. Since evolution has given rise to few, if any, purposeless physiological responset, it is logical to assume that crying has one or more functions that enhance survival. 
Although some observers have suggested that crying is a way to clicit assistance form others (as a crying baby might from its mother), the shedding of tears is hardly necessary to get help. Vocal cries would have been quite enough, more likely than tears to gain attention, So, it appears, there must be something special about tears themselves. 
    Indeed, the new studies suggest that emotional tears may play a direct role in alleviating stress, University of Minnesota researchers who are studying the chemical composition of tears have recently isolated two important chemicals from emotional tears. Both chemicals are found only in tears that are shed in response to cmotion. Tears shed because of exposure to =cut onion would contain no such substance. 
Researchers at several other institutions are investigating the usefulness of tears as a means of diagnosing human ills and monitoring drugs. 
    At Tulane University’s Teat Analysis Laboratory Dr.Peter Kastl and his colleagues report that they can use tears to detect drug abuse and exposure to medication(药物), to determine whether a contact lens fits properly of why it may be uncomfortable, to study the causes of “dry eye” syndrome and the effects of eye surgery, and perhaps even to measure exposure to environmental pollutants. 
    At Columbia University Dt.Liasy Faris and colleagues are studying tears for clues to the diagnosis of diseases away from the eyes. Tears can be obtained painlessly without invading the body and only tiny amounts are needed to perform highly refined analyses. 31. It is known from the first paragraph that ________. 
A) shedding tears gives unpleasant feelings to American 
B) crying may often imitate people or even result in tragedy 
C) crying usually wins sympathy from other people 
D) one who sheds tears in public will be blamed 32. What does “both those responses to tears”(Line 6, , 1) refer to? 
A) Crying out of sorrow and shedding tears for happiness. 
B) The embarrassment and unpleasant sensation of the observers. 
C) The tear shedder’s apology and the observer’s effort to stop the crying. 
D) Linking illness with crying and finding the chemical composition of tears. 33. “Counterproductive” (Lines 6-7, ,1) very probably means “________”. 
A) having no effect at all 
B) leading to tension 
C) producing disastrous impact 
D) harmful to health 34. What does the author say about crying? 
A) It is a pointless physiological response to the environment. 
B) It must have a role to play in man’s survival. 
C) It is meant to get attention and assistance. 
D) It usually produces the desired effect. 35. What can be inferred from the new studies of tears? 
A) Emotional tears have the function of reducing stress. 
B) Exposure to excessive medication may increase emotional tears. 
C) Emotional tears can give rise to “dry eye” syndrome in some cases. 
D) Environmental pollutants can induce the shedding of emotional tears. Passage Four 
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage. 
    It is no secret among athletes that in order to improve performance you’ve got to work hard. However, hard training breaks you down and makes you weaker, It is rest that makes you stronger. Improvement only occurs during the rest period following hard training. This adaptation is accomplished by improving efficiency of the heart and certain systems within the muscle cells. During recovery periods these systems build to greater levels to compensate for the stress that you have applied. The result is that you are now at a higher level of performance. 
    If sufficient rest is not included in a training program, imbalance between excess training and inadequate rest will occur, and performance will decline. The “overtraining syndrome(综合症)” is the name given to the collection of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms due to overtraining that has persisted for weeks to months. It is marked by cumulative exhaustion that persists even after recovery periods. 
The most common symptom is fatigue. This may limit workouts and may be present at rest. The athlete may also become moody, easily imitated, have altered sleep patterns, become depressed, or lose the competitive desire and enthusiasm for the sport, Some will report decreased appetite and weight loss. Physical symptoms include persistent muscular soreness, increased frequency of viral (病毒性的) illnesses, and increased incidence of injuries. 
     The treatment for the overtraining syndrome is rest. The longer the overtraining has occurred, the more rest required, Therefore, early detection is very important, If the overtraining has only occurred for a short period of time (e.g. 3-4 weeks) then interrupting training for 3-5 days is usually sufficient rest. It is important that the factors that lead to overtraining be identified and corrected. Otherwise, the overtraining syndrome is likely to recur. The overtraining syndrome should be considered in any athlete who manifests symptoms of prolonged fatigue and whose performance has leveled off or decreased. It is important to exclude any underlying illness that may be responsible for the fatigue. 
36. The first paragraph of the passage tells us that ________. 
A) the harder an athlete trains, the better his performance will be 
B) rest after vigorous training improves an athlete’s performance 
C) strict systematic training is essential to an athlete’s top performance 
D) improvement of an athlete’s performance occurs in the course of training 37. By “overtraining” the author means ________. 
A) a series of physical symptoms that occur after training 
B) undue emphasis on the importance of physical exertion 
C) training that is not adequately compensated for by rest 
D) training that has exceeded an athlete’s emotional limits 38. What does the passage tell us about the “overtraining” syndrome? 
A) It occurs when athletes lose interest in sports. 
B) It appears right after a hard training session. 
C) The fatigue it results in is unavoidable in the athlete’s training process. 
C) It manifests itself in fatigue which lingers even after a recovery period. 39. What does the phrase “level off” (Line 7, ,4)most probably mean? 
A) Slow down. 
B) Become dull. 
C) Stop improving. 
D) Be on the decline. 40. The author advises at the end of the passage that ________. 
A) overtraining syndrome should be treated as a serious illness 
B) overtraining syndrome should be prevented before it occurs 
C) an athlete with overtraining syndrome should take a lengthy rest 
D) illness causing fatigue should not be mistaken for overtraining syndrome Part Ⅲ  Vocabulary (20 minutes)

For years, doctors advised their patients that the only thing taking multivitamins does is give them expensive urine (尿). After all, true vitamin deficiencies are practically unheard of in industrialized countries. Now it seems those doctors may have been wrong. The results of a growing number of studies suggest that even a modest vitamin shortfall can be harmful to your health. Although proof of the benefits of multivitamins is still far from certain, the few dollars you spend on them is probably a good investment.	Or at least that's the argument put forward in the New England Journal of Medicine. Ideally, say Dr. Walter Willett and Dr. Meir Stampfer of Harvard, all vitamin supplements would be evaluated in scientifically rigorous clinical trials. But those studies can take a long time and often raise more questions than they answer. At some point, while researchers work on figuring out where the truth lies, it just makes sense to say the potential benefit outweighs the cost.	The best evidence to date concerns folate, one of the B vitamins. It's been proved to limit the number of defects in embryos (胚胎), and a recent trial found that folate in combination with vitamin B 12 and a form of B6 also decreases the re-blockage of arteries after surgical repair.	The news on vitamin E has been more mixed. Healthy folks who take 400 international units daily for at least two years appear somewhat less likely to develop heart disease. But when doctors give vitamin E to patients who already have heart disease, the vitamin doesn't seem to help. It may turn out that vitamin E plays a role in prevention but cannot undo serious damage.	Despite vitamin C's great popularity, consuming large amounts of it still has not been positively linked to any great benefit. The body quickly becomes saturated with C and simply excretes (排泄) any excess.	The multivitamins question boils down to this: Do you need to wait until all the evidence is in before you take them, or are you willing to accept that there's enough evidence that they don't hurt and could help? 	If the latter, there's no need to go to extremes and buy the biggest horse pills or the most expensive bottles. Large doses can cause trouble, including excessive bleeding and nervous system problems.	Multivitamins are no substitute for exercise and a balanced diet, of course. As long as you understand that any potential benefit is modest and subject to further refinement, taking a daily multivitamin makes a lot of sense.21.	At one time doctors discouraged taking multivitamins because they believed that multivitamins ____.	A) could not easily be absorbed by the human body	B) were potentially harmful to people's health	C) were too expensive for daily consumption	D) could not provide any cure for vitamin deficiencies22.	According to the author, clinical trials of vitamin supplements ____.	A) often result in misleading conclusions	B) take time and will not produce conclusive results	C) should be conducted by scientists on a larger scale	D) appear to be a sheer waste of time and resources23.	It has been found that vitamin E _____.	A) should be taken by patients regularly and persistently	B) can effectively reduce the recurrence of heart disease	C) has a preventive but not curative effect on heart disease	D) should be given to patients with heart disease as early as possible24.	It can be seen that large doses of multivitamins _____.	A) may bring about serious side effects	B) may help prevent excessive bleeding	C) are likely to induce the blockage of arteries	D) are advisable for those with vitamin deficiencies25.	The author concludes the passage with the advice that _____.	A) the benefit of daily multivitamin intake outweighs that of exercise and a balanced diet	B) it's risky to take multivitamins without knowing their specific function	C) the potential benefit of multivitamins can never be overestimated	D) it's reasonable to take a rational dose of multivitamins dailyPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.	Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge (剧增) of women in the workforce may portend a rejection of marriage. Many women, according to this hypothesis, would rather work than marry. The converse (反面) of this concern is that the prospects of becoming a multi-paycheck household could encourage marriages. In the past, only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision. Now, however, the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner. Data show that economic downturns tend to postpone marriage because the parties cannot afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead. As the economy rebounds, the number of marriages also rises.	Coincident with the increase in women working outside the home is the increase in divorce rates. Yet, it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause-and-effect conclusions. The impact of a wife's work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions. The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage. But the reverse is equally plausible. Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage. Given high unemployment, inflationary problems, and slow growth in real earnings, a working wife can increase household income and relieve some of these pressing financial burdens. By raising a family's standard of living, a working wife may strengthen her family's financial and emotional stability.	Psychological factors also should be considered. For example, a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house. She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce. On the other hand, if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home, work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union.	Also, a major part of women's inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that, in most cases, men have remained the main breadwinners. With higher earning capacity and status occupations outside of the home comes the capacity to exercise power within file family. A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house. Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions, it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities.26.	The word "portend" (Line 2, Para. 1) is closest in meaning to “_____”.	A) defy	C) suffer from	B) signal	D) result from27.	It is said in the passage that when the economy slides, _____.	A) men would choose working women as their marriage partners	B) more women would get married to seek financial security	C) even working women would worry about their marriages	D) more people would prefer to remain single for the time being28.	If women find fulfillment through work outside the home, _____.	A) they are more likely to dominate their marriage partners	B) their husbands are expected to do more housework	C) their marriage ties can be strengthened	D)they tend to put their career before marriage29.	One reason why women with no career may seek a divorce is that _____.	A) they feel that they have been robbed of their freedom	B) they are afraid of being bossed around by their husbands	C) they feel that their partners fail to live up to their expectations	D) they tend to suspect their husbands' loyalty to their marriage30.	Which of the following statements can best summarize the author's view in the passage?	A) The stability of marriage and the divorce rate may reflect the economic situation of the country.	B) Even when economically independent, most women have to struggle for real equality in marriage.	C) In order to secure their marriage women should work outside the home and remain independent	D) The impact of the growing female workforce on marriage varies from case to case.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage,	For most thinkers since the Greek philosophers, it was self-evident that there is something called human nature, something that constitutes the essence of man. There were various views about what constitutes it, but there was agreement that such an essence exists -- that is to say, that there is something by virtue of which man is man. Thus man was defined as a rational being, as a social animal, an animal that can make tools, or a symbol-making animal.	More recently, this traditional view has begun to be questioned. One reason for this change was the increasing emphasis given to the historical approach to man. An examination of the history of humanity suggested that man in our epoch is so different from man in previous times that it seemed unrealistic to assume that men in every age have had in common something that can be called "human nature." The historical approach was reinforced, particularly in the United States, by studies in the field of cultural anthropology (人类学). The study of primitive peoples has discovered such a diversity of customs, values, feelings, and thoughts that many anthropologists arrived at the concept that man is born as a blank sheet of paper on which each culture writes its text. Another factor contributing to the tendency to deny the assumption of a fixed human nature was that the concept has so often been abused as a shield behind which the most inhuman acts are committed. In the name of human nature, for example, Aristotle and most thinkers up to the eighteenth century defended slavery. Or in order to prove the rationality and necessity of the capitalist form of society, scholars have tried to make a case for acquisitiveness, competitiveness, and selfishness as innate (天生的) human traits. Popularly, one refers cynically to "human nature" in accepting the inevitability of such undesirable human behavior as greed, murder, cheating and lying.	Another reason for skepticism about the concept of human nature probably lies in the influence of evolutionary thinking. Once man came to be seen as developing in the process of evolution, the idea of a substance which is contained in his essence seemed untenable. Yet I believe it is precisely from an evolutionary standpoint that we can expect new insight into the problem of the nature of man.31.	The traditional view of "human nature" was strongly challenged by _____.	A) the emergence of the evolutionary theory	B) the historical approach to man	C) new insight into human behavior	D) the philosophical analysis of slavery32.	According to the passage, anthropologists believe that human beings _____.	A) have some traits in common	B) are born with diverse cultures	C) are born without a fixed nature	D) change their characters as they grow up33.	The author mentioned Aristotle, a great ancient thinker, in order to _____.	A) emphasize that he contributed a lot to defining the concept of "human nature"	B) show that the concept of "human nature" was used to justify social evils	C) prove that he had a profound influence on the concept of "human nature"	D) support the idea that some human traits are acquired34.	The word "untenable" (Line 3) in the last paragraph of the passage most probably means _____.	A) invaluable	C) changeable	B) imaginable	D) indefensible35.	Most philosophers believed that human nature _____.	A) is the quality distinguishing man from other animals	B) consists of competitiveness and selfishness	C) is something partly innate and partly acquired	D) consists of rationality and undesirable behaviorPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.	Richard Satava, program manager for advanced medical technologies, has been a driving force in bringing virtual reality to medicine, where computers create a "virtual" or simulated environment for surgeons and other medical practitioners (从业者).	"With virtual reality we'll be able to put a surgeon in every trench," said Satava. He envisaged a time when soldiers who are wounded fighting overseas are put in mobile surgical units equipped with computers.	The computers would transmit images of the soldiers to surgeons back in the U.S. The surgeons would look at the soldier through virtual reality helmets (头盔) that contain a small screen displaying the image of the wound. The doctors would guide robotic instruments in the battlefield mobile surgical unit that operate on the soldier. 	Although Satava's vision may be years away from standard operating procedure, scientists are progressing toward virtual reality surgery. Engineers at an international organization in  are developing a tele-operating device. As surgeons watch a three-dimensional image of the surgery, they move instruments that are connected to a computer, which passes their movements to robotic instruments that perform the surgery. The computer provides, feedback to the surgeon on force, textures, and sound.	These technological wonders may not yet be part of the community hospital setting but increasingly some of the machinery is finding its way into civilian medicine. At , surgeon Lucia Zamorano takes images of the brain from computerized scans and uses a computer program to produce a 3-D image. She can then maneuver the 3-D image on the computer screen to map the shortest, least invasive surgical path to the rumor (肿瘤). Zamorano is also using technology that attaches a probe to surgical instruments so that she can track their positions. While cutting away a tumor deep in the brain, she watches the movement of her surgical tools in a computer graphics image of the patient's brain taken before surgery.	During these procedures -- operations that are done through small cuts in the body in which a miniature camera and surgical tools are maneuvered -- surgeons are wearing 3-D glasses for a better view. And they are commanding robot surgeons to cut away tissue more accurately than human surgeons can.	Satava says, "We are in the midst of a fundamental change in the field of medicine."36.	According to Richard Satava, the application of virtual reality to medicine _____.	A) will enable surgeons to be physically present on every battlefield	B) can raise the spirits of soldiers wounded on the battlefield	C) will greatly improve medical conditions on the battlefield	D) can shorten the time for operations on soldiers wounded on the battlefield37.	Richard Satava has visions of _____.	A) using a remote-control technique to treat wounded soldiers fighting overseas	B) wounded soldiers being saved by doctors wearing virtual reality helmets on the battlefield	C) wounded soldiers being operated on by specially trained surgeons	D) setting up mobile surgical units overseas38.	How is virtual reality surgery performed?	A) It is performed by a computer-designed high precision device.	B) Surgeons wear virtual reality helmets to receive feedback provided by a computer.	C) Surgeons move robotic instruments by means of a computer linked to them.	D) A 3-D image records the movements of the surgeons during the operation.39.	During virtual reality operations, the surgeon can have a better view of the cuts in the body because _____.	A) he is looking at the cuts on a computer screen	B) the cuts can be examined from different angles	C) the cuts have been highly magnified	D) he is wearing 3-D glasses40.	Virtual reality operations are an improvement on conventional surgery in that they _____.	A) cause less pain to the wounded	B) allow the patient to recover more quickly	C) will make human surgeons' work less tedious	D) are done by robot surgeons with greater precisionPart III	Vocabulary	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

It was the worst tragedy in maritime (航海的) history, six times more deadly than the Titanic.	When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes (鱼雷) fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II, more than 10,000 people - mostly women, children  and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany - were packed aboard. An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down. Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down. Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard. Most people froze immediately. Tll never forget the screams," says Christa Ntitzmann, 87, one of the  1,200 survivors. She recalls watching the ship, brightly lit, slipping into its dark grave - and into seeming nothingness, rarely mentioned for more than half a century.	Now 's Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead, including more than 4,000 children - with his latest novel Crab Walk, published last  month. The book, which will be out in English next year, doesn't dwell on the sinking; its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later: "Nobody wanted to hear  about it, not here in the West (of ) and not at all in the East." The reason was obvious. As Grass put it in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche: "Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant, we didn't have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings.''	The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable - and necessary. By unreservedly owning up to their country's monstrous crimes in the Second World War, Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad, marginalize (使...不得势) the neo- Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors. Today's unified  is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long, troubled history. For that, a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay. But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they' ye now earned the right to discuss the full historical record. Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims, but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy.21.	Why does the author say the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was the worst tragedy in maritime history?	A) It was attacked by Russian torpedoes.	B) Most of its passengers were frozen to death.	C) Its victims were mostly women and children.	D) It caused the largest number of casualties.22.	Hundreds of families dropped into the sea when	A) a strong ice storm tilted the ship	B) the cruise ship sank all of a sudden	C) the badly damaged ship leaned toward one side	D) the frightened passengers fought desperately for lifeboats23.	The Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy was little talked about for more than half a century because Germans	A) were eager to win international acceptance	B) felt guilty for their crimes in World War II	C) ad been pressured to keep silent about it	D) were afraid of offending their neighbors24.	How does Gunter Grass revive the memory of the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy?	A) By presenting the horrible scene of the torpedo attack.	B) By describing the ship's sinking in great detail.	C) By giving an interview to the weekly Die Woche.	D) By depicting the survival of a young pregnant woman.25.	It can be learned from the passage that Germans no longer think that	A) they will be misunderstood if they talk about the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy	B) the Wilhelm Gustloff tragedy is a reasonable price to pay for the nation's past misdeeds	C) Germany is responsible for the horrible crimes it committed in World War II	D) it is wrong to equate their sufferings with those of other countriesPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.	Given the lack of fit between gifted students and their schools, it is not surprising that such students often have little good to say 'about their school experience. In one study of 400 adul who had achieved distinction in all areas of life, researchers found that three-fifths of these individuals either did badly in school or were unhappy in school. Few MacArthur Prize fellows, winners of the MacArthur Award for creative accomplishment, had good things to say about their precollegiate schooling if they had not been placed in advanced programs. Anecdotal (名人轶事) reports support this. Pablo Picasso, Charles Darwin, Mark Twain, Oliver Goldsmith, and William Butler Yeats all disliked school. So did Winston Churchill, who almost failed out of , an elite British school. About Oliver Goldsmith, one of his teachers remarked, "Never was so dull a boy." Often these children realize that they know more than their teachers, and their teachers often feel that these children are arrogant, inattentive, or unmotivated.	Some of these gifted people may have done poorly in school because their, gifts were not scholastic. Maybe we can account for Picasso in this way. But most fared poorly in school not because they lacked ability but because they found school unchallenging and consequently lost interest. Yeats described the lack of fit between his mind and school: "Because I had found it difficult to attend to anything less interesting than my own thoughts, I was difficult to teach." As noted earlier, gifted children of all kinds tend to be strong-willed nonconformists. Nonconformity and stubbornness (and Yeats's level of arrogance and self-absorption) are likely to lead to Conflicts with teachers.	When highly gifted students in any domain talk about what was important to the development  of their abilities, they are far more likely to mention their families than their schools or teachers. A writing prodigy (神童) studied by David Feldman and Lynn Goldsmith was taught far more about writing by his journalist father than his English teacher. High-IQ children, in  studied by Miraca Gross had much more positive feelings about their families than their schools. About half of the mathematicians studied by Benjamin Bloom had little good to say about school. They all did well in school and took honors classes when available, and some skipped grades.26.	The main point the author is making about schools is that	A) they should satisfy the needs of students from different family backgrounds	B) they are often incapable of catering to the needs of talented students	C) they should organize their classes according to the students' ability	D) they should enroll as many gifted students as possible27.	The author quotes the remarks of one of Oliver Goldsmith's teachers	A) to provide support for his argument	B) to illustrate the strong will of some gifted children	C) to explain how dull students can also be successful	D) to show how poor Oliver's performance was at school28.	Pablo Picasso is listed among the many gifted children who	A) paid no attention to their teachers in class	B) contradicted their teachers much too often	C) could not cope with their studies at school successfully	D) behaved arrogantly and stubbornly in the presence of their teachers29.	Many gifted people attributed their success.	A) mainly to parental help and their education at home	B) both to school instruction and to their parents' coaching	C) more to their parents' encouragement than to school training	D) less to their systematic education than to their talent30.	The root cause of many gifted students having bad memories of their school years is that	A) their nonconformity brought them a lot of trouble	B) they were seldom praised by their teachers	C) school courses failed to inspire or motivate them	D) teachers were usually far stricter than their parentsPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage,	When we worry about who might be spying on our private lives, we usually think about the Federal agents. But the private sector outdoes the government every time. It's Linda Tripp, not the FBI, who is facing charges under 's laws against secret telephone taping. It's our banks, not the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that pass our private financial data to telemarketing fin'ms.	Consumer activists are pressing Congress for better privacy laws without much result so far. The legislators lean toward letting business people track our financial habits virtually at will.	As an example of what's going on, consider U.S. Bancorp, which was recently sued for deceptive practices by the state of . According to the lawsuit, the bank supplied a telemarketer called MemberWorks with sensitive customer data such as names,, ph'one numbers, bank-account and credit-card numbers, Social Security numbers, account balances and credit limits.	With these customer lists in hand, MemberWorks started dialing for dollars - selling dental plans, videogames, computer software and other products and services. Customers who accepted a "free trial offer" had, 30 days to cancel. If the deadline passed, they were charged automatically through their bank or credit-card accounts. U.S. Bancorp collected a share of the revenues.	Customers were doubly deceived, the lawsuit claims. They. didn't know that the bank was giving account numbers to MemberWorks. And if customers asked, they were led to think the answer was no.	The state sued MemberWorks separately for deceptive selling. Thecompany de'hies that it did anything wrong. For its part, U.S. Bancorp settled without admitting any mistakes. But it agreed to stop exposing its customers to nonfinancial products sold by outside firms. A few top banks decided to do the same. Many other banks will still do business with MemberWorks and similar firms.	And banks will still be mining data from your account in order to sell you financial products, including things of little value, such as credit insurance and credit-card protection plans.	You have almost no protection from businesses that use your personal accounts for profit. For example, no federal law shields "transaction and experience" information - mainly the details of your bank and credit-card accounts. Social Security numbers are for sale by private fa'ms. They've generally agreed not to sell to the public. But to businesses, the numbers are an open book. Selfregulation doesn't work. A firm might publish a privacy-protection policy, but who enforces it?	Take U.S. Bancorp again. Customers were told, in writing, that "all personal information you supply to us will be considered confidential." Then it sold your data to MemberWorks. The bank even claims that it doesn't "sell" your data at all. It merely "shares" it and reaps a profit. Now you know.31.	Contrary to popular belief, the author finds that spying on people's privacy	A) is mainly carried out by means of secret taping	B) has been intensified with the help of the IRS	C) is practiced exclusively by the FBI	D) is more prevalent in business circles32.	We know from the passage that	A) legislators are acting to pass a law to provide better privacy protection	B) most states are turning a blind eye to the deceptive practices of private businesses	C) the state of  is considering drawing up laws to protect private information	D) lawmakers are inclined to give a free hand to businesses to inquire into customers' buying habits33.	When the "free trial" deadline is over, you'll be charged without notice for a product or service if	A) you fail to cancel it within the specified period	B) you happen to reveal your credit card number	C) you find the product or service unsatisfactory	D) you fail to apply for extension of the deadline34.	Businesses do not regard information concerning personal bank accounts as private because	A) its revelation will do no harm to consumers under the current protection policy	B) it is considered "transaction and experience" information unprotected by law	C) it has always been considered an open secret by the general public	D) its sale can be brought under control through self-regulation35.	We can infer from the passage that	A) banks will have to change their ways of doing business	B) privacy protection laws will soon be enforced	C) consumers' privacy will continue to be invaded	D) "free trial" practice will eventually be bannedPassage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.	It's hardly news that the immigration system is a mess. Foreign nationals have long been slipping across the border with fake papers, and visitors who arrive in the  legitimately often overstay their legal welcome without being punished. But since Sept. 11, it's become clear that terrorists have been shrewdly factoring the weaknesses of our system into their plans. In addition to their mastery of forging passports, at least three of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers (劫机者) were here on expired visas. That's been a safe bet until now. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) ( 移民归化局 ) lacks the resources, and apparently the inclination, to keep track of the estimated 2 million foreigners who have intentionally overstayed their welcome.	But this laxness (马虎) toward immigration fraud may be about to change. Congress has already taken some modest steps. The U.S.A. Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 tragedy, requires the FBI, the Justice Department, the State Department and the INS to share more data, which will make it easier to stop watch-listed terrorists at the border.	But what's really needed, critics say, is even tougher laws and more resources aimed at tightening up border security. Reformers are calling for a rollback of rules that hinder law enforcement.They also want the INS to hire hundreds more border patrol agents and investigators to keep illegal immigrants out and to track them down once they're here. Reformers also want to see the INS set up a database to monitor whether visa holders actually leave the country when they are required to.	All these proposed changes were part of a new border-security bill that passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate last week. Before Sept. 11, legislation of this kind had been blocked by two powerful lobbies: universities, which rely on tuition from foreign students who could be kept out by the new law, and business, which relies on foreigners for cheap labor. Since the attacks, they've backed off. The bill would have passed this time but for congressional maneuverings and is expected to be reintroduced and to pass next year.	Also on the agenda for next year: a proposal, backed by some influential law-makers, to split the INS into two agencies - a good cop that would tend to service functions like processing citizenship papers and a bad cop that would concentrate on border inspections, deportation and other functions. One reason for the division, supporters say, is that the INS has in recent years become too focused on serving tourists and immigrants. After the Sept. l 1 tragedy, the INS should pay more attention to serving the millions of ordinary Americans who rely on the nation's border security to protect them from terrorist attacks.36.	Terrorists have obviously taken advantage of	A) the legal privileges granted to foreigners	B) the excessive hospitality of the American people	C) the irresponsibility of the officials at border checkpoints	D) the low efficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service37.	We learn from the passage that coordinated efforts will be made by various  government agencies to	A) refuse the renewing of expired visas	B) ward off terrorist suspects at the border	C) prevent the forgery of immigration papers	D). limit the number Of immigrants to the 38.	It can be inferred from the passage that before Sept. 11, aliens with expired visas	A) might have them extended without trouble	B) would be closely watched by FBI agents	C) might stay on for as long as [hey wished	D) would live in constant fear of deportation39.	It is believed by many that all these years the INS	A) has been serving two contradictory functions	B) has been too liberal in granting visas to tourists and immigrants indiscriminately	C) has over-emphasized its service functions at the expense of the nation's security	D) has ignored the pleas of the two powerful lobbies40.	Before Sept. 11, the U.S. Congress had been unable to pass stricter immigration laws because	A) they might have kept away foreign students and cheap labor	B) it was difficult to coordinate the efforts of the congressmen	C) education and business circles cared little about national security	D) resources were not available for their enforcement Part III	Vocabulary	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.	I had an experience some years ago which taught me something about the ways in which people make a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I had to officiate at two funerals on successive days for two elderly women in my community. Both had died “full of years,” as the Bible would say; both yielded to the normal wearing out of the body after a long and full life. Their homes happened to be near each other, so I paid condolence (吊唁) calls on the two families on the same afternoon. 	At the first home, the son of the deceased (已故的) woman said to me, “If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It’s my fault that she died.” At the second home, the son of the other deceased woman said, “If only I hadn’t insisted on my mother’s going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride, the abrupt change of climate, was more than she could take. It’s my fault that she’s dead.” 	When things don’t turn out as we would like them to, it is very tempting to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Priests know that any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out badly, they believe that the opposite course – keeping Mother at home, postponing the operation – would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse? 	There seem to be two elements involved in our readiness to feel guilt. The first is our pressing need to believe that the world makes sense, that there is a cause for every effect and a reason for everything that happens. That leads us to find patterns and connections both where they really exist and where they exist only in our minds. 	The second element is the notion that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. It seems to be a short step from believing that every event has a cause to believing that every disaster is our fault. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. Psychologists speak of the infantile myth of omnipotence (万能). A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and summons the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely outgrow that infantile notion that our wishes cause things to happen.21.	What is said about the two deceased elderly women?	A) They lived out a natural life.	B) They died of exhaustion after the long plane ride.	C) They weren’t accustomed to the change in weather.	D) They died due to lack of care by family members.22.	The author had to conduct the two women’s funerals probably because ________.	A) he wanted to console the two families	B) he was an official from the community	C) he had great sympathy for the deceased	D) he was priest of the local church23.	People feel guilty for the deaths of their loved ones because ________.	A) they couldn’t find a better way to express their grief	B) they believe that they were responsible	C) they had neglected the natural course of events	D) they didn’t know things often turn out in the opposite direction24.	In the context of the passage, “... the world makes sense” (Line 2, , 4) probably means that ________.	A) everything in the world is predetermined	B) the world can be interpreted in different ways	C) there’s an explanation for everything in the world	D) we have to be sensible in order to understand the world25.	People have been made to believe since infancy that ________.	A) everybody is at their command	B) life and death is an unsolved mystery	C) every story should have a happy ending	D) their wishes are the cause of everything that happensPassage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.	Frustrated with delays in , Bay Area officials said Thursday they planned to take matters into their own hands to regulate the region’s growing pile of electronic trash. 	A  councilwoman and a  supervisor said they would propose local initiatives aimed at controlling electronic waste if the  law-making body fails to act on two bills stalled in the Assembly. They are among a growing number of  cities and counties that have expressed the same intention. 	Environmentalists and local governments are increasingly concerned about the toxic hazard posed by old electronic devices and the cost of safely recycling those products. An estimated 6 million televisions and computers are stocked in  homes, and an additional 6,000 to 7,000 computers become outdated every day. The machines contain high levels of lead and other hazardous substances, and are already banned from California landfills (垃圾填埋场).	Legislation by Senator Byron Sher would require consumers to pay a recycling fee of up to $30 on every new machine containing a cathode (阴极) ray tube. Used in almost all video monitors and televisions, those devices contain four to eight pounds of lead each. The fees would go toward setting up recycling programs, providing grants to non-profit agencies that reuse the tubes and rewarding manufacturers that encourage recycling.	A separate bill by Los Angeles-area Senator Gloria Romero would require high-tech manufacturers to develop programs to recycle so-called e-waste.	If passed, the measures would put  at the forefront of national efforts to manage the refuse of the electronic age.	But high-tech groups, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and the American Electronics Association, oppose the measures, arguing that fees of up to $30 will drive consumers to online, out-of-state retailers.	“What really needs to occur is consumer education. Most consumers are unaware they’re not supposed to throw computers in the trash,” said Roxanne Gould, vice president of government relations for the electronics association.	Computer recycling should be a local effort and part of residential waste collection programs, she added.	Recycling electronic waste is a dangerous and specialized matter, and environmentalists maintain the state must support recycling efforts and ensure that the job isn’t contracted to unscrupulous (毫无顾忌的) junk dealers who send the toxic parts overseas.	“The graveyard of the high-tech revolution is ending up in rural ,” said Ted Smith, director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. His group is pushing for an amendment to Sher’s bill that would prevent the export of e-waste.26.	What step were Bay Area officials going to take regarding e-waste disposal?	A) Exert pressure on manufacturers of electronic devices.	B) Lay down relevant local regulations themselves.	C) Lobby the lawmakers of the California Assembly.	D) Rally support to pass the stalled bills.27.	The two bills stalled in the California Assembly both concern ________.	A) regulations on dumping hazardous substances into landfills	B) the sale of used electronic devices to foreign countries	C) the funding of local initiatives to reuse electronic trash	D) the reprocessing of the huge amounts of electronic waste in the state28.	Consumers are not supposed to throw used computers in the trash because ________.	A) they contain large amounts of harmful substances	B) this is banned by the  government	C) some parts may be recycled for use elsewhere	D) unscrupulous dealers will retrieve them for profit29.	High-tech groups believe that if an extra $30 is charged on every TV or computer purchased in , consumers will _______.	A) abandon online shopping	B) buy them from other states	C) strongly protest against such a charge	D) hesitate to upgrade their computers30.	We learn from the passage that much of ’s electronic waste has been _______.	A) collected by non-profit agencies	B) dumped into local landfills	C) exported to foreign countries	D) recycled by computer manufacturersPassage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage,	Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts, widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.	Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of   , who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates  educational practice in math or science.’’ The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”	The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in , is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.	Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual  communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.	On average,  students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.	For instance, eighth graders in the  cover about 33 topics in math versus just  . Among science courses, the international gap is even wider.  curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including , , , and . Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.	The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in . “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”	Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.	In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards “face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声).”31.	According to the passage, the teaching of science and math in  is ________.	A) focused on tapping students’ potential	B) characterized by its diversity	C) losing its vitality gradually	D) going downhill in recent years32.

So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and expect to clone a cat soon. They just might succeed in cloning Missy this spring – or perhaps not for another 5 years. It seems the reproductive system of man’s best friend is one of the mysteries of modern science.	Westhusin’s experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog’s eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos (胚胎) carrying Missy’s DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate (代孕的) mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted fetuses (胎) may be acceptable when you’re dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. “Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,” he says.	Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin’s phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. “A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,” says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy’s mysterious billionaire owner; he’s put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M’s research.	Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy’s fine qualities after she does die. The prototype is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy’s master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament. In a statement of purpose, Missy’s owner and the A&M team say they are “both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.”	Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.	However, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems. “Why would you ever want to clone humans,” Westhusin asks, “when we’re not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?”36.	By “stupid endeavor” (Line 2, Para. 1), Westhusin means to say that ________.	A) animal cloning is not worth the effort at all	B) animal cloning is absolutely impractical	C) human cloning should be done selectively	D) human cloning is a foolish undertaking37.	What does the first paragraph tell us about Westhusin’s dog cloning project?	A) Its success is already in sight.	B) Its outcome remains uncertain.	C) It is doomed to utter failure.	D) It is progressing smoothly.38.	By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to ________.	A) study the possibility of cloning humans	B) search for ways to modify its temperament	C) examine the reproductive system of the dog species	D) find out the differences between Missy and its clones39.

It can be seen that present cloning techniques ________.	A) still have a long way to go before reaching maturity	B) have been widely used in saving endangered species	C) provide insight into the question of nature vs. nurture	D) have proved quite adequate for the cloning of humansPart III		Vocabulary	(20 minutes)Directions:	There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C),and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.Passage One Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.Low-level slash-and-burn farming doesn’t harm rainforest. On the contrary, it helps farmers and improves forest soils. This is the unorthodox view of a German soil scientist who has shown that burnt clearings in the Amazon, dating back more than 1,000 years, helped create patches of rich, fertile soil that farmers still benefit from today.  Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because they lack minerals and because the heat and heavy rainfall destroy most organic matter in the soils within four years of it reaching the forest floor. This means topsoil contains few of the ingredients needed for long-term successful farming.    But Bruno Glaser, a soil scientist of the , has studied unexpected patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon. These soils contain lots of organic matter.Glaser has shown that most of this fertile organic matter comes from “black carbon”-the organic particles from camp fires and charred (烧成炭的) wood left over from thousands of years of slash-and-burn farming. ”The soils, known as Terra Preta, contained up to 70times more black carbon than the surrounding soil, ”says Glaser.Unburnt vegetation rots quickly, but black carbon persists in the soil for many centuries. Radiocarbon dating shows that the charred wood in Terra Preta soils is typically more than 1,000 years old.“Slash-and-burn farming can be good for soils provided it doesn’t completely burn all the vegetation, and leaves behind charred wood,” says Glaser. “It can be better than manure (粪肥).” Burning the forest just once can leave behind enough black carbon to keep the soil fertile for thousands of years. And rainforests easily regrow after small-scale clearing. Contrary to the conventional view that human activities damage the environment, Glaser says: ”Black carbon combined with human wastes is responsible for the richness of Terra Preta soils.”Terra Preta soils turn up in large patches all over the Amazon, where they are highly prized by farmers. All the patches fall within 500 square kilometers in the central Amazon. Glaser says the widespread presence of pottery (陶器) confirms the soil’s human origins.The findings add weight to the theory that large areas of the Amazon have recovered so well from past periods of agricultural use that the regrowth has been mistaken by generations of biologists for “virgin” forest.During the past decade, researchers have discovered hundreds of large earth works deep in the jungle. They are up to 20 meters high and cover up to a square kilometer. Glaser claims that these earth works, built between AD 400 and 1400, were at the heart of urban civilizations. Now it seems the richness of the Terra Preta soils may explain how such civilizations managed to feed themselves.11. We learn from the passage that the traditional view of slash-and-burn farming is that        .A) it does no harm to the topsoil of the rainforestB) it destroys rainforest soilsC) it helps improve rainforest soilsD) it diminishes the organic matter in rainforest soils 12. Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because       .A) the composition of the topsoil is rather unstableB) black carbon is washed away by heavy rainsC) organic matter is quickly lost due to heat and rainD) long-term farming has exhausted the ingredients essential to plant growth 13. Glaser made his discovery by        .A) studying patches of fertile soils in the central AmazonB) examining pottery left over by ancient civilizationsC) test-burning patches of trees in the central AmazonD) radiocarbon-dating ingredients contained in forest soils 14. What does Glaser say about the regrowth of rainforests?A) They take centuries to regrow after being burnt.B) They cannot recover unless the vegetation is burnt completely.C) Their regrowth will be hampered by human habitation.D) They can recover easily after slash-and-burn farming. 15. From the passage it can be inferred that .A) human activities will do grave damage to rainforestsB) Amazon rainforest soils used to be the richest in the worldC) farming is responsible for the destruction of the Amazon rainforestsD) there once existed an urban civilization in the Amazon rainforestsPassage TwoQuestions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.As a wise man once said, we are all ultimately alone. But an increasing number of Europeans are choosing to be so at an ever earlier age. This isn’t the stuff of gloomy philosophical contemplations, but a fact of ’s new economic landscape, embraced by sociologists, real-estate developers and ad executives alike. The shift away from family life to solo lifestyle, observes a French sociologist, is part of the “irresistible momentum of individualism” over the last century. The communications revolution, the shift from a business culture of stability to one of mobility and the mass entry of women into the workforce have greatly wreaked havoc on(扰乱) Europeans’ private lives.’s new economic climate has largely fostered the trend toward independence. The current generation of home-aloners came of age during ’s shift from social democracy to the sharper, more individualistic climate of American style capitalism. Raised in an era of privatization and increased consumer choice, today’s tech-savvy(精通技术的) workers have embraced a free market in love as well as economics. Modern Europeans are rich enough to afford to live alone, and temperamentally independent enough to want to do so.Once upon a time, people who lived alone tended to be those on either side of marriage-twentysomething professionals or widowed senior citizens. While pensioners, particularly elderly women, make up a large proportion of those living alone, the newest crop of singles are high earners in their 30s and 40s who increasingly view living alone as a lifestyle choice. Living alone was conceived to be negative-dark and cold, while being together suggested warmth and light. But then came along the idea of singles. They were young, beautiful, strong! Now, young people want to live alone.The booming economy means people are working harder than ever. And that doesn’t leave much room for relationships. Pimpi Arroyo, a 35-year-old composer who lives alone in a house in , says he hasn’t got time to get lonely because he has too much work. “I have deadlines which would make life with someone else fairly difficult.” Only an Ideal Woman would make him change his lifestyle, he says. Kaufmann, author of a recent book called “The Single Woman and Prince Charming,” thinks this fierce new individualism means that people expect more and more of mates, so relationships don’t last long-if they start at all. Eppendorf, a blond Berliner with a deep tan, teaches grade school in the mornings. In the afternoon she sunbathes or sleeps, resting up for going dancing. Just shy of 50, she says she’d never have wanted to do what her mother did-give up a career to raise a family. Instead, “I’ve always done what I wanted to do: live a self-determined life.”16. More and more young Europeans remain single because        .A) they are driven by an overwhelming sense of individualismB) they have entered the workforce at a much earlier ageC) they have embraced a business culture of stabilityD) they are pessimistic about their economic future 17. What is said about European society in the passage?A) It has fostered the trend towards small families.B) It is getting closer to American-style capitalism.C) It has limited consumer choice despite a free market.D) It is being threatened by irresistible privatization. 18. According to Paragraph 3, the newest group of singles are         .A) warm and lighthearted      B) on either side of marriageC) negative and gloomy       D) healthy and wealthy 19. The author quotes Eppendorf to show that        .A) some modern women prefer a life of individual freedomB) the family is no longer the basic unit of society in present-day C) some professional people have too much work to do to feel lonelyD) most Europeans conceive living a single life as unacceptable 20. What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?A) To review the impact of women becoming high earners.B) To contemplate the philosophy underlying individualism.C) To examine the trend of young people living alone.D) To stress the rebuilding of personal relationships.Passage ThreeQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.Supporters of the biotech industry have accused an American scientist of misconduct after she testified to the  government that a genetically modified(GM) bacterium could cause serious damage if released.The New Zealand Life Sciences Network, an association of pro-GM scientists and organisations, says the view expressed by Elaine Ingham, a soil biologist at    in , was exaggerated and irresponsible. It has asked her university to discipline her.But Ingham stands by her comments and says the complaints are an attempt to silence her. “They’re trying to cause trouble with my university and get me fired,” Ingham told New Scientist.The controversy began on 1 February, when Ingham testified before ’s Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, which will determine how to regulate GM organisms. Ingham claimed that a GM version of a common soil bacterium could spread and destroy plants if released into the wild. Other researchers had previously modified the bacterium to produce alcohol from organic waste. But Ingham says that when she put it in soil with wheat plants, all of the plants died within a week.“We would lose terrestrial(陆生的) plants...this is an organism that is potentially deadly to the continued survival of human beings,” she told the commission. She added that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) canceled its approval for field tests using the organism once she had told them about her research in 1999.But last week the New Zealand Life Sciences Network accused Ingham of “presenting inaccurate, careless and exaggerated information” and “generating speculative doomsday scenarios(世界末日的局面) that are not scientifically supportable”. They say that her study doesn’t even show that the bacteria would survive in the wild, much less kill massive numbers of plants. What’s more, the network says that contrary to Ingham’s claims, the EPA was never asked to consider the organism for field trials.The EPA has not commented on the dispute. But an e-mail to the network from Janet Anderson, director of the EPA’s bio-pesticides(生物杀虫剂) division, says “there is no record of a review and/or clearance to field test” the organism.Ingham says EPA officials had told her that the organism was approved for field tests, but says she has few details. It’s also not clear whether the organism, first engineered by a German institute for biotechnology, is still in use.Whether Ingham is right or wrong, her supporters say opponents are trying unfairly to silence her.“I think her concerns should be taken seriously. She shouldn’t be harassed in this way,”  says Ann Clarke, a plant biologist at the  of  in  who also testified before the commission. “It’s n attempt to silence the opposition.”21. The passage centers on the controversy         .A) between American and  biologists over genetic modificationB) as to whether the study of genetic modification should be continuedC) over the possible adverse effect of a GM bacterium on plantsD) about whether Elaine Ingham should be fired by her university 22. Ingham insists that her testimony is based on         .A) evidence provided by the EPA of the B) the results of an experiment she conducted herselfC) evidence from her collaborative research with German biologistsD) the results of extensive field tests in  23. According to Janet Anderson, the EPA        .A) has cancelled its approval for field tests of the GM organismB) hasn’t reviewed the findings of Ingham’s researchC) has approved field tests using the GM organismD) hasn’t given permission to field test the GM organism 24. According to Ann Clarke, the  Life Sciences Network         .A) should gather evidence to discredit Ingham’s claimsB) should require that the research by their biologists be regulatedC) shouldn’t demand that Ingham be disciplined for voicing her viewsD) shouldn’t appease the opposition in such a quiet way 25. Which of the following statements about Ingham is TRUE?A) Her testimony hasn’t been supported by the EPA.B) Her credibility as a scientist hasn’t been undermined.C) She is firmly supported by her university.D) She has made great contributions to the study of GM bacteria.Passage FourQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.Every fall, like clockwork, Linda Krentz of , felt her brain go on strike. “I just couldn’t get going in the morning,” she says. “I’d get depressed and gain 10 pounds every winter and lose them again in the spring.” Then she read about seasonal affective disorder, a form of depression that occurs in fall and winter, and she saw the light-literally. Every morning now she turns on a specially constructed light box for half an hour and sits in front of it to trick her brain into thinking it’s still enjoying those long summer days. It seems to work.Krentz is not alone. Scientists estimate that 10 million Americans suffer from seasonal depression and 25 million more develop milder versions. But there’s never been definitive proof that treatment with very bright lights makes a difference. After all, it’s hard to do a double-blind test when the subjects can see for themselves whether or not the light is on. That’s why nobody has ever separated the real effects of light therapy from placebo(安慰剂) effects.Until now. In three separate studies published last month, researchers report not only that light therapy works better than a placebo but that treatment is usually more effective in the early morning than in the evening. In two of the groups, the placebo problem was resolved by telling patients they were comparing light boxes to a new anti-depressant device that emits negatively charged ions(离子). The third used the timing of light therapy as the control.Why does light therapy work? No one really knows. “Our research suggests it has something to do with shifting the body’s internal clock,” says psychiatrist Dr. Lewey. The body is programmed to start the day with sunrise, he explains, and this gets later as the days get shorter. But why such subtle shifts make some people depressed and not others is a mystery.That hasn’t stopped thousands of winter depressives from trying to heal themselves. Light boxes for that purpose are available without a doctor’s prescription. That bothers psychologist Michael Terman of . He is worried that the boxes may be tried by patients who suffer from mental illness that can’t be treated with light. Terman has developed a questionnaire to help determine whether expert care is needed.In any event, you should choose a reputable manufacturer. Whatever product you use should emit only visible light, because ultraviolet light damages the eyes. If you are photosensitive(对光敏感的), you may develop a rash. Otherwise, the main drawback is having to sit in front of the light for 30 to 60 minutes in the morning. That’s an inconvenience many winter depressives can live with.26. What is the probable cause of Krentz’s problem?A) An unexpected gain in body weight.B) Unexplained impairment of her nervous system.C) Weakening of her eyesight with the setting in of winter.D) Poor adjustment of her body clock to seasonal changes. 27. By saying that Linda Krentz “saw the light”(Line 4, Para. 1), the author means that she “         ”.A) learned how to lose weightB) realized what her problem wasC) came to see the importance of lightD) became light-hearted and cheerful 28. What is the CURRENT view concerning the treatment of seasonal depression with bright lights?A) Its effect remains to be seen.B) It serves as a kind of placebo.C) It proves to be an effective therapy.D) It hardly produces any effects. 29. What is psychologist Michael Terman’s major concern?A) Winter depressives will be addicted to using light boxes.B) No mental patients would bother to consult psychiatrists.C) Inferior light boxes will emit harmful ultraviolet lights.D) Light therapy could be misused by certain mental patients. 30. Which of the following statements is TRUE?A) Winter depressives prefer light therapy in spite of its inconvenience.B) Light therapy increases the patient’s photosensitivity.C) Eye damage is a side effect of light therapy.D) Light boxes can be programmed to correspond to shifts in the body clock.Part Ⅲ Vocabulary (20 minutes)Directions: There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

For each blank there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D) on the right side of the paper. You should choose the ONE that best fits into the passage. Then mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.Although there are many skillful Braille readers, thousands of other blind people find it difficult to learn that system. They are thereby shut    61    from the world of books and newspapers, having to    62    on friends to read aloud to them.A young scientist named Raymond Kurzweil has now designed a computer which is a major     providing aid to the    64   . His machine, Cyclops, has a camera that    65    any page, interprets the print into sounds, and then delivers them orally in a robot-like    66    through a speaker. By pressing the appropriate buttons    67    Cyclops’s keyboard, a blind person can “read” any    68    document in the English language.This remarkable invention represents a tremendous    69    forward in the education of the handicapped. At present, Cyclops costs ＄50,000.   70   , Mr. Kurzweil and his associates are preparing a smaller    71    improved version that will sell    72    less than half that price. Within a few years, Kurzweil    73    the price range will be low enough for every school and library to    74    one. Michael Hingson, Director of the National Federation for the Blind, hopes that    75    will be able to buy home    76    of Cyclops for the price of a good television set.Mr. Hingson’s organization purchased five machines and is now testing them in , , , , and . Blind people have been     those tests, making lots of    78    suggestions to the engineers who helped to produce Cyclops.“This is the first time that blind people have ever done individual studies     product was put on the market,” Hingson said. “Most manufacturers believed that having the blind help the blind was like telling disabled people to teach other disabled people. In that    80   , the manufacturers have been the blind ones.”61. A) up B) down C) in D) off62. A) dwell B) rely C) press D) urge63. A) execution B) distinction C) breakthrough D) process64.

Americans assume that people need some time to themselves or some time alone to think about things or recover their (S4) psychological energy. Americans have great (S5) understanding foreigners who always want to be with another person who dislike being alone.If the parents can (S6) it, each child will have his or her own bedroom. Having one’s own bedroom, her books, her books and so on. These things will be hers and no one else’s.Americans assumer that (S9). Doctors, lawyers, psychologists, and others have rules governing confidentiality that are intended to prevent information about their clients’ personal situations form becoming known to others.American’s attitude about privacy can be hard for foreigners to understand.

When those boundaries are crossed , an American’s body will visibly stiffen and his manner will become cool and aloof. Part Ⅴ                       Writing In this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay entitled Say No to Pirated Products.1.       目前盗版的现象比较严重2.       造成这种现象的原因及危害3.       我们应该怎么做？盗版 piracy (n.) 盗版产品 pirated products 知识产权 intellectual property rights 侵犯版权 infringe sb’s copyright; copyright infringementSay No to Pirated Products答案：1-5.CBDCA       6-10.CBDAB11-15.BCADD     16-20.ABDAC 21-25.CBBCA     26-30.DBCDA31-35.AADCB     36-40.DACBD41-45.BCABD     46-50.BADAC51-55.DCBBA     56-60.DCBAD61-65.DBCDA     66-70.DABAC71-75.ABABC     76-80.ADBCC复合式听写：S1. lie   S2 associated   S3. assign  S4. spent  S5. difficulty   S6. afford   S7 infant S8. she is entitled to a place of her own where she can be by herself, and keep her possessionsS9. people will have their private thoughts that might never be shared with anyoneS10.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)Passage One Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.Each summer, no matter how pressing my work schedule, I take off one day exclusively for my son. We call it dad-son day. This year our third stop was the amusement park, where he discovered that he was tall enough to ride one of the fastest roller coasters(过山车) in the world. We blasted through face-stretching turns and loops for ninety seconds. Then, as we stepped off the ride, he shrugged and, in a distressingly calm voice, remarked that it was not as exciting as other rides he’d been on. As I listened, I began to sense something seriously out of balance.Throughout the season, I noticed similar events all around me. Parents seemed hard pressed to find new thrills for indifferent kids. Surrounded by ever-greater stimulation, their young faces wore looking disappointed and bored.Facing their children’s complaints of “nothing to do”. Parents were shelling out large numbers of dollars for various forms of entertainment. In many cases the money seemed to do little more than buy transient relief from the terrible moans of their bored children. This set me pondering the obvious question: “How can it be so hard for kids to find something to do when there’s never been such a range of stimulating entertainment available to them?”Why do children immersed in this much excitement seem starved for more? That was, I realized, the point. I discovered during my own reckless adolescence that what creates excitement is not going fast, but going faster. Thrills have less to do with speed than changes in speed.I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of years at these levels of feverish activity. It is no mystery to me why many teenagers appear apathetic (麻木的) and burned out, with a “been there, done that” air of indifference toward much of life. As increasing numbers of friends’ children are prescribed medications-stimulants to deal with inattentiveness at school or anti-depressants to help with the loss of interest and joy in their lives-l question the role of kids boredom in some of the diagnoses.My own work is focused on the chemical imbalances and biological factors related to behavioral and emotional disorders. These are complex problems. Yet I’ve been reflecting more and more on how the pace of life and the intensity of stimulation may be contributing to the rising rates of psychiatric problems among children and adolescents in our society.21. The author felt surprised in the amusement park at the face that________.A) his son was not as thrilled by the roller coaster ride as expectedB) his son blasted through the turns and loops with his face stretchedC) his son appeared distressed but calm while riding the roller coasterD) his son could keep his balance so well on the fast-moving roller coaster22. According to the author, children are bored _________.A) unless their parents can find new thrills for themB) when they don’t have any access to stimulating fun gamesC) when they are left alone at weekends by their working parentsD) even if they are exposed to more and more kinds of entertainment23. From his own experience. the author came to the conclusion that children seem to expect ________.A) a much wider variety of sports facilities B) activities that require sophisticated C) ever-changing thrilling forms of recreationD) physical exercises that are more challenging24. In . 6 . the author expresses his doubt about the effectiveness of trying to change children indifference toward much of life by ________.A) diverting their interest from electronic visual gamesB) prescribing medications for their temporary relief C) creating more stimulating activities for them D) spending more money on their entertainment25. In order to alleviate children’s boredom, the author would probably suggest ____ .A) adjusting the pace of life and intensity of stimulationB) promoting the practice of dad-son daysC) consulting a specialist in child psychologyD) balancing school work with extracurricular activities Passage Two Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.It used to be that people were proud to work for the same company for the whole of their working lives. They’d get a gold watch at the end of their productive years and a dinner featuring speeches by their bosses praising their loyalty/But today’s rich capitalists have regressed (倒退) to the “survival of the fittest” ideas and their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their stockholders but only to themselves. Instead of giving out gold watches worth a hundred or so dollars for forty or so years of work, they grab tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars as they sell for their own profit the company they may have been with for only a few years.The new rich selfishly act on their own to unfairly grab the wealth that the country as a whole has produced. The top l percent of the population now has wealth equal to the whole bottom 95 percent and they want more. Their selfishness is most shamelessly expressed in downsizing and outsourcing (将产品包给外公司做) because these business maneuvers don’t act to create new jobs as the founders of new industries used to do, but only to cut out jobs while keeping the money value of what those jobs produced for themselves.To keep the money machine working smoothly the rich have bought all the politicians from the top down. The president himself is constantly leaving. Washington and the business of the nation because he is summoned to “fundraising dinners” where fat cats pay a thousand or so dollars a plate to worm their way into government not through service but through donations of vast amounts of money. Once on the inside they have both political parties busily tearing up all the regulations that protect the rest of us from the greed of the rich.The middle class used to be loyal to the free enterprise system. In the past, the people of the middle class mostly thought they’d be rich themselves someday or have a good shot at becoming rich. But nowadays income is being distributed more and more unevenly and corporate loyalty is a thing of the past. The middle class may also wake up to forget its loyalty to the so-called free enterprise system altogether and the government which governs only the rest of us while letting the corporations do what they please with our jobs. As things stand. if somebody doesn’t wake up, the middle class is on a path to being downsized all the way to the bottom of society.26. It can be inferred form the first paragraph that people used to place a high value on _________ .A) job securityB) bosses’ praiseC) corporate loyalty D) retirement benefits27. The author is strongly critical of today’s rich capitalists for _________.A) not giving necessary assistance to laid-off workersB) maximizing their profits at the expense of workers C) not setting up long-term goals for their companies D) rewarding only those who are considered the fittest28. The immediate consequence of the new capitalists’ practice is ________ .A) loss of corporate reputation B) lower pay for the employees C) a higher rate of unemployment D) a decline in business transactions29. The rich try to sway the policy of the government by ________ .A) occupying important positions in both political parties B) making monetary contributions to decision-makersC) pleasing the public with generous donations D) constantly hosting fundraising dinners30. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage?A) To call on the middle class to remain loyal to the free enterprise system.B) To warn the government of the shrinking of the American middle class.C) To persuade the government to change its current economic policies.D) To urge the middle class to wake up and protect their own interests. Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passageIntel chairman Andy Grove has decided to cut the Gordian knot of controversy surrounding stem cell research by simply writing a check.The check, which he pledged last week, could be for as much as $5 million, depending on how many donors make gifts of between $50,000 and $500,000. which he has promised to match. It will be made out to the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF).Thanks in part to such private donations, university research into uses for human stem cells the cells earliest stages of development that can form any body part-will continue in . With private financial support, the state will be less likely to lose talented scientists who would be tempted to leave the field or even leave the field or even leave the country as research dependent on federal money slows to a glacial (极其缓慢的) pace.Hindered by limits President Bush placed on stem cell research a year ago, scientists are turning to laboratories that can carry out work without using federal money. This is awkward for universities. Which must spend extra money building separate labs and keeping rigorous records proving no federal funds were involved. Grove’s donation, a first step toward a $20 million target at UCSF. Will ease the burden.The president’s decision a year ago to allow research on already existing stem cell lines was portrayed as a reasonable compromise between scientists’ needs for cells to work with, and concerns that this kind of research cold lead to wholesale creation and destruction of human embryos (胚胎)。 Cloned infants and a general contempt for human life.But Bush’s effort to please both sides ended up pleasing neither. And it certainly didn’t provide the basis for cutting edge research. Of the 78 existing sxisting stern cell lines which Bush said are all that science would ever need, only one is in this country ( at the University of Wisconsin), and only five are ready for distribution to researchers. All were grown in conjunction with mouse cells, making future therapeutic (治疗的) uses unlikely.The Bush administration seems bent on satisfying the small but vocal group of Americans who oppose stem cell research under any conditions. Fortunately, Grove and others are more interested in advancing scientific research that could benefit the large number of Americans who suffer from Parkinson’s disease, nerve injuries, heart diseases and many other problems.31.When Andy Grove decided to cut the Gordian knot, he meant to _______.A) put an end to stem cell research B) end Intel’s relations with GordianC) settle the dispute on stem cell research quicklyD) expel Gordian from stem cell research for good32. For UCSF to carry on stem cell research, new funds have to come from _______.A) interested businesses and individuals B) the United States federal government C) a foundation set up by the Intel CompanyD) executives of leading American companies33. As a result o the limits Bush placed on stem cell research, American universities will __________.A) conduct the research in laboratories overseas B) abandon the research altogether in the near futureC) have to carry out the research secretly D) have to raise money to build separate labs34. We may infer from the passage that future therapeutic uses of stem cells will be unlikely unless ________.A) human stem cells are used in the research B) a lot more private donations can be secured C) more fcderal money is used for the research D) talented scientists are involved in the research 35. The reason lying behind President Bush’s placing limits on stem cell research is that __________.A) his administration is financially pinched B) he did not want to offend its opponents C) it amounts to a contempt for human life D) it did not promise any therapeutic valuePassage Four Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.This looks like the year that hard-pressed tenants in  will get relief-not just in the marketplace, where rents have eased, but from the state capital .Two significant tenant reforms stand a good chance of passage. One bill, which will give more time to tenants being evicted (逐出)，will soon be heading to the governor’s desk. The other, protecting security deposits, faces a vote in the Senate on Monday.For more than a century, landlords in  have been able to force tenants out with only 30 days’ notice. That will now double under SB 1403, which got through the Assembly recently The new protection will apply to renters who have been in an apartment for at least a year.Even 60 days in a tight housing market won’t be long enough for some families to find at apartment near where their kids go to school, But it will be an improvement in cities like San Jose where renters rights groups charge that unscrupulous (不择手段的) landlords have kicked ou tenants on short notice to put up rents.The California Landlords Association argued that landlords shouldn’t have to wait 60 days to get rid of problem tenants. But the bill gained support when a Japanese real estate investor sent ou 30-day eviction notices to 550 families renting homes in  and . The land lords lobby eventually dropped its opposition and instead its forces against AB 2330, re garding security deposits.Sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden of , the bill would establish; procedure and a timetable for tenants to get back security deposits.Some landlords view security deposits as a free month’s rent, theirs for the taking. In mos cases, though, there are honest disputes over damages-what constitutes ordinary wear and tear. AB 2330 would give a tenant the right to request a walk-through with the landlord and to make the repairs before moving out; reputable landlords already do this. It would increase the penalty for failing to return a deposit.The original bill would have required the landlord to pay interest in the deposit. The landlords lobby protested that it would involve too much paperwork over too little money-less than $ year on a $1,000 deposit, at current rates. On Wednesday, the sponsor dropped the interest section to increase the chance of passage.Even in its amended form, AB 2330 is , like SB 1403 , vitally important for tenants and should be made state law.36. We learn form the passage that SB1403 will benefit _______.A) long-term real estate investors B) short-term tenants in  C) landlords in the State of  D) tenants renting a house over a year37. A 60-day notice before eviction may not be early enough for renters because _______.A) moving house is something difficult to arrangeB) appropriate housing may not be readily available C) more time is needed for their kids’ school registration D) the furnishing of the new house often takes a long time38. Very often landlords don’t return tenants’ deposits on the pretext that _______.A) their rent has not been paid in timeB) there has been ordinary wear and tearC) tenants have done damage to the house D) the 30-day notice for moving out is over39. Why did the sponsor of the AB 2330 bill finally give in on the interest section?A) To put an end to a lengthy argument.B) To urge landlords to lobby for its passage.C) To cut down the heavy paperwork for its easy passage.D) To make it easier for the State Assembly to pass the bill.40. It can be learned from the passage that ________.A) both bills are likely to be made state laws B) neither bill will pass through the Assembly  2330 stands a better chance of passage D)  and  support SB 1403Part III Vocabulary (20 minutes)41.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes) 
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage. 
Passage one 
    Too many vulnerable child-free adults are being ruthlessly(无情的)manipulated into parent-hood by their parents , who think that happiness among older people depends on having a grand-child to spoil. We need an organization to help beat down the persistent campaigns of grandchildless parents. It’s time to establish Planned Grandparenthood, which would have many global and local benefits. 
    Part of its mission would be to promote the risks and realities associated with being a grandparent. The staff would include depressed grandparents who would explain how grandkids break lamps, bite, scream and kick. Others would detail how an hour of baby-sitting often turns into a crying marathon. More grandparents would testify that they had to pay for their grandchild’s expensive college education. 
    Planned grandparenthood’s carefully written literature would detail all the joys of life grand-child-free a calm living room, extra money for luxuries during the golden years, etc. Potential grandparents would be reminded that, without grandchildren around, it’s possible to have a conversation with your kids, who----incidentally-----would have more time for their own parents . 
    Meanwhile, most children are vulnerable to the enormous influence exerted by grandchildless parents aiming to persuade their kids to produce children . They will take a call from a persistent parent, even if they’re loaded with works. In addition, some parents make handsome money offers payable upon the grandchild’s birth. Sometimes these gifts not only cover expenses associated with the infant’s birth, but extras, too, like a vacation. In any case, cash gifts can weaken the resolve of even the noblest person. 
    At Planned Grandparenthood, children targeted by their parents to reproduce could obtain non-biased information about the insanity of having their own kids. The catastrophic psychological and economic costs of childbearing would be emphasized. The symptoms of morning sickness would be listed and horrors of childbirth pictured. A monthly newsletter would contain stories about overwhelmed parents and offer guidance on how childless adults can respond to the different lobbying tactics that would-be grandparents employ. 
    When I think about all the problems of our overpopulated world and look at our boy grabbing at the lamp by the sofa, I wish I could have turned to Planned Grandparenthood when my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me. 
    If I could have, I might not be in this parenthood predicament( 窘境) . But here’s the crazy irony, I don’t want my child-free life back . Dylan’s too much fun. 
21. What’s the purpose of the proposed organization Planned Grandparenthood? 
A) To encourage childless couples to have children. 
B) To provide facilities and services for grandchildless parents. 
C) To offer counseling to people on how to raise grandchildren. 
D) To discourage people from insisting on having grandchildren. 22. Planned Grandparenthood would include depressed grandparents on its staff in order to____. 
A) show them the joys of life grandparents may have in raising grandchildren 
B) draw attention to the troubles and difficulties grandchildren may cause 
C) share their experience in raising grandchildren in a more scientific way 
D) help raise funds to cover the high expense of education for grandchildren23. According to the passage, some couples may eventually choose to have children because_____. 
A) they find it hard to resist the carrot-and-stick approach of their parents 
B) they have learn from other parents about the joys of having children 
C) they feel more and more lonely ad they grow older 
D) they have found it irrational to remain childless 24.By saying “… my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me” (Line 2-3,Para. 6), the author means that _________. 
A) her parents kept pressuring her to have a child 
B) her parents liked to have a grandchild in their arms 
C) her parents asked her to save for the expenses of raising a child 
D) her parents kept blaming her for her child’s bad behavior 25.What does the author really of the idea of having children? 
A) It does more harm than good. 
B) It contributes to overpopulation. 
C) It is troublesome but rewarding. 
D) It is a psychological catastrophe Passage Two 
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage. 
    Ask most people how they define the American Dream and chances are they’ll say, “Success.” The dream of individual opportunity has been home in American since Europeans discovered a “new world” in the . Early immigrants like Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur praised highly the freedom and opportunity to be found in this new land. His glowing descriptions of a classless society where anyone could attain success through honesty and hard work fired the imaginations of many European readers: in Letters from an American Farmer (1782) he wrote. “We are all excited at the spirit of an industry which is unfettered (无拘无束的) and unrestrained, because each person works for himself … We have no princes, for whom we toil (干苦力活)，starve, and bleed: we are the most perfect society now existing in the world.” The promise of a land where “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” drew poor immigrants from Europe and fueled national expansion into the western territories. 
    Our national mythology (神化) is full of illustration the American success story. There’s Benjamin Franklin, the very model of the self-educated, self-made man, who rose from modest origins to become a well-known scientist, philosopher, and statesman. In the nineteenth century, Horatio Alger, a writer of fiction for young boys, became American’s best-selling author with rags-to-riches tales. The notion of success haunts us: we spend million every year reading about the rich and famous, learning how to “make a fortune in real estate with no money down,” and “dressing for success.” The myth of success has even invaded our personal relationships: today it’s as important to be “successful” in marriage or parenthoods as it is to come out on top in business. 
    But dreams easily turn into nightmares. Every American who hopes to “make it” also knows the fear of failure, because the myth of success inevitably implies comparison between the haves and the have-nots, the stars and the anonymous crowd. Under pressure of the myth, we become indulged in status symbols: we try to live in the “right” neighborhoods, wear the “right” clothes, eat the “right” foods. These symbols of distinction assure us and others that we believe strongly in the fundamental equality of all, yet strive as hard as we can to separate ourselves from our fellow citizens. 26. What is the essence of the American Dream according to Crevecoeur? 
A) People are free to develop their power of imagination. 
B) People who are honest and work hard can succeed. 
C) People are free from exploitation and oppression. 
D) People can fully enjoy individual freedom.27.By saying “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” (Line 10, Para. 1), the author means __________ . 
A) the more diligent one is, the bigger his returns 
B) laborious work ensures the growth of an industry 
C) a man’s business should be developed step by step 
D) a company’s success depends on its employees’ hard work 28. The characters described in Horatio Alger’s novels are people who _______. 
A) succeed in real estate investment 
B) earned enormous fortunes by chances 
C) became wealthy after starting life very poor 
D) became famous despite their modest origins 29. It can be inferred from the last sentence of the second paragraph that _________. 
A) business success often contributes to a successful marriage 
B) Americans wish to succeed in every aspect of life 
C) good personal relationships lead to business success 
D) successful business people provide good care for their children 30. What is the paradox of American culture according to the author? 
A) The American road to success is full of nightmares. 
B) Status symbols are not a real indicator of a person’s wealth. 
C) The American Dream is nothing but an empty dream. 
D) What Americans strive after often contradicts their beliefs. Passage Three 
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage. 
    Public distrust of scientists stems in part from the blurring of boundaries between science and technology, between discovery and manufacture. Most government, perhaps all governments, justify public expenditure on scientific research in terms of the economic benefits the scientific enterprise ha brought in the past and will bring in the future. Politicians remind their voters of the splendid machines ‘our scientists’ have invented, the new drugs to relieve old ailments (病痛), and the new surgical equipment and techniques by which previously intractable (难治疗的) conditions may now be treated and lives saved. At the same time, the politicians demand of scientists that they tailor their research to ‘economics needs’, that they award a higher priority to research proposals that are ‘near the market’ and can be translated into the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. Dependent, as they are, on politicians for much of their funding, scientists have little choice but to comply. Like the rest of us, they are members of a society that rates the creation of wealth as the greatest possible good. Many have reservations, but keep them to themselves in what they perceive as a climate hostile to the pursuit of understanding for its own sake and the idea of an inquiring, creative spirit. 
    In such circumstances no one should be too hard on people who are suspicious of conflicts of interest. When we learn that the distinguished professor assuring us of the safety of a particular product holds a consultancy with the company making it, we cannot be blamed for wondering whether his fee might conceivably cloud his professional judgment. Even if the professor holds no consultancy with any firm, some people many still distrust him because of his association with those who do, or at least wonder about the source of some his research funding. 
    This attitude can have damaging effects. It questions the integrity of individuals working in a profession that prizes intellectual honesty as the supreme virtue, and plays into the hands of those who would like to discredit scientists by representing then a venal (可以收买的). This makes it easier to dismiss all scientific pronouncements, but especially those made by the scientists who present themselves as ‘experts’. The scientist most likely to understand the safety of a nuclear reactor, for example, is a nuclear engineer declares that a reactor is unsafe, we believe him, because clearly it is not to his advantage to lie about it. If he tells us it is safe, on the other hand, we distrust him, because he may well be protecting the employer who pays his salary.31. What is the chief concern of most governments when it comes to scientific research? 
A) Support from the votes. 
B) The reduction of public expenditure. 
C) Quick economics returns. 
D) The budget for a research project. 32. Scientist have to adapt their research to ‘economic needs’ in order to _________ . 
A) impress the public with their achievements 
B) pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake 
C) obtain funding from the government 
D) translate knowledge into wealth 33. Why won’t scientists complain about the government’s policy concerning scientific research? 
A) They think they work in an environment hostile to the free pursuit of knowledge. 
B) They are accustomed to keeping their opinions to themselves. 
C) They know it takes patience to win support from the public. 
D) They think compliance with government policy is in the interests of the public. 34. According to the author, people are suspicious of the professional judgment of scientists because ___________ . 
A) their pronouncements often turn out to be wrong 
B) sometimes they hide the source of their research funding 
C) some of them do not give priority to intellectual honesty 
D) they could be influenced by their association with the project concerned 35. Why does the author say that public distrust of scientists can have damaging effects? 
A) It makes things difficult for scientists seeking research funds. 
B) People would not believe scientists even when they tell the truth. 
C) It may dampen the enthusiasm of scientists for independent research. 
D) Scientists themselves may doubt the value of their research findings. Passage Four 
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage. 
    In many ways, today’s business environment has changed qualitatively since the late 1980s. The end of the Cold War radically altered the very nature of the world’s politics and economics. In just a few short years, globalization has started a variety of trends with profound consequences: the opening of markets, true global competition, widespread deregulation (解除政府对……的控制) of industry, and an abundance of accessible capital. We have experienced both the benefits and risks of a truly global economy, with both Wall Street and Main Street (平民百姓) feeling the pains of economic disorder half a world away. 
    At the same time, we have fully entered the Information Age, Starting breakthroughs in information technology have irreversibly altered the ability to conduct business unconstrained by the traditional limitations of time or space. Today, it’s almost impossible to imagine a world without intranets, e-mail, and portable computers. With stunning speed, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we work, shop, do business, and communicate. 
    As a consequence, we have truly entered the Post-Industrial economy. We are rapidly shifting from an economy based on manufacturing and commodities to one that places the greatest value on information, services, support, and distribution. That shift, in turn, place an unprecedented premium on “knowledge workers,” a new class of wealthy, educated, and mobile people who view themselves as free agents in a seller’s market. 
    Beyond the realm of information technology, the accelerated pace of technological change in virtually every industry has created entirely new business, wiped out others, and produced a Pervasive( 广泛的) demand for continuous innovation. New product, process ,and distribution technologies provide powerful levers for creating competitive value. More companies are learning the importance of destructive technologies-----innovations that hold the potential to make a product line, or even an entire business segment, virtually outdated. 
    Another major trend has been the fragmentation of consumer and business markets. There’s a growing appreciation that superficially similar groups of customers may have very different preferences in terms of what they want to buy and how they want to buy it. Now, new technology makes it easier, faster ,and cheaper to identify and serve targeted micro-markets in ways that were physically impossible or prohibitively expensive in the past. Moreover, the trend feeds on itself, a business’s ability to serve sub-markets fuels customers’ appetites for more and more specialized offerings. 36. According to the first paragraph, the chances in the business environment in the past decades can be attributed to __________. 
A) technological advances 
B) worldwide economic disorder 
C) the fierce competition in industry 
D) the globalization of economy 37. what idea does the author want to convey in the second paragraph ? 
A) The rapid development of information technology has taken businessmen by surprise 
B) Information technology has removed the restrictions of time and space in business transactions 
C) The Internet, intranets, e-mail, and portable computers have penetrated every corner of the world. 
D) The way we do business today has brought about startling breakthroughs in information technology. 38. If a business wants to thrive in the Post-Industrial economy,__________ 
A) it has to invest more capital in the training of free agents to operate in a seller’s market 
B) it should try its best to satisfy the increasing demands of mobile knowledgeable people 
C) it should not overlook the importance of information, services, support, and distribution 
D) it has to provide each of its employees with the latest information about the changing market 39. In the author’s view, destructive technologies are innovations which _________ 
A) can eliminate an entire business segment 
B) demand a radical change in providing services 
C) may destroy the potential of a company to make any profit 
D) call for continuous improvement in ways of doing business 40. With the fragmentation of consumer and business markets ______________ 
A) an increasing number of companies have disintegrated 
B) manufacturers must focus on one special product to remain competitive in the market 
C) it is physically impossible and prohibitively expensive to do business in the old way 
D) businesses have to meet individual customers’ specific needs in order to succeed . Part III Vocabulary (20minutes)

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.There are good reasons to be troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies. Television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what’s wrong with a society that presents videos of domestic violence as entertainment. Most researchers agree that the causes of real-world violence are complex. A 1993 study by the   of Sciences listed “biological, individual, family, peer, school, and community factors” as all playing their parts.　　Viewing abnormally large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals.　　The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality (因果关系). Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the 　　American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: “At this time, well over 1,000 studies… point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.”　　Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the , reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out “the most doubtful measures of aggression”, only 28% supported a connection.　　The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read ‘aggressive’ or ‘non-aggressive’ words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intent of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction.　　Another appropriate ster would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society.21. Why is there so much violence shown in movies, TV and video games?A) There is a lot of violence in the real world today.B) Something has gone wrong with today’s society.C) Many people are fond of gunplay and bloodshed.D) Showing violence is thought to be entertaining.22. What is the skeptics (Line 3. Para.3) view of media violence?A) Violence on television is a fairly accurate reflection of real-world life.B) Most studies exaggerate the effect of media violence on the viewers.C) A causal relationship exists between media and real-world violence.D) The influence of media violence on children has been underestimated.23. The author uses the term “alarmists” (Line 1. Para.5) to refer to those who ______.A) use standardized measurements in the studies of media violenceB) initiated the debate over the influence of violent media on realityC) assert a direct link between violent media and aggressive behaviorD) use appropriate methodology in examining aggressive behavior24. In refuting the alarmists, the author advances his argument by first challenging____.A) the source and amount of their dataB) the targets of their observationC) their system of measurementD) their definition of violence25. What does the author think of the debate concerning the relationship between the media and violence?A) More studies should be conducted before conclusions are drawn.B) It should come to an end since the matter has now been settled.C) The past studies in this field have proved to be misleading.D) He more than agrees with the views held by the alarmists.Passage TwoQuestions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.　　You’re in trouble if you have to buy your own brand-name prescription drugs. Over the past decade, prices leaped by more than double the inflation rate. Treatments for chronic conditions can easily top ＄ month-no wonder that one in four Americans can’s afford to fill their prescriptions. The solution? A hearty chorus of “O Canada.” North of the border, where price controls reign, those same brand-name drugs cost 50% to 80% less.　　The Canadian option is fast becoming a political wake-up call, “If our neighbors can buy drugs at reasonable prices, why can’t we?” Even to whisper that thought provokes anger. “Un-American!” And-the propagandists’ trump card (王牌)—“Wreck our brilliant health-care system.” Super-size drug prices, they claim, fund the research that sparks the next generation of wonder drugs. No sky-high drug price today, no cure for cancer tomorrow. So shut up and pay up.Common sense tells you that’s a false alternative. The reward for finding. Say, a cancer cure is so huge that no one’s going to hang it up. Nevertheless, if Canada-level pricing came to the United States, the industry’s profit margins would drop and the pace of new-drug development would slow. Here lies the American dilemma. Who is all this splendid medicine for? Should our health-care system continue its drive toward the best of the best, even though rising numbers of patients can’t afford it? Or should we direct our wealth toward letting everyone in on today’s level of care? Measured by saved lives, the latter is almost certainly the better course.　　To defend their profits, the drug companies have warned Canadian wholesalers and pharmacies(药房) not to sell to Americans by mail, and are cutting back supplies to those who dare.　　Meanwhile, the administration is playing the fear card. Officials from the Food and Drug Administration will argue that Canadian drugs might be fake, mishandled, or even a potential threat to life.　　Do bad drugs fly around the Internet? Sure-and the more we look, the more we’ll find, But I haven’t heard of any raging epidemics among the hundreds of thousands of people buying cross-border.　　Most users of prescription drugs don’s worry about costs a lot. 　　They’re sheltered by employee insurance, owing just a $20 co-pay. 　　The financial blows rain, instead, on the uninsured, especially the chronically ill who need expensive drugs to live, This group will still include middle-income seniors on Medicare, who’ll have to dig deeply into their pockets before getting much from the new drug benefit that starts in 2006.26. What is said about the consequence of the rocketing drug prices in the ?A) A quarter of Americans can’t afford their prescription drugs.B) Many Americans can’t afford to see a doctor when they fall ill.C) Many Americans have to go to  to get medical treatment.D) The inflation rate has been more than doubled over the years.27. It can be inferred that  can follow the Canadian model and curb its soaring drug prices by _____.A) encouraging people to buy prescription drugs onlineB) extending medical insurance to all its citizensC) importing low-price prescription drugs from D) exercising price control on brand-name drugs28. How do propagandists argue for the  drug pricing policy?A) Low prices will affect the quality of medicines in .B) High prices are essential to funding research on new drugs.C) Low prices will bring about the anger of drug manufacturers.D) High-price drugs are indispensable in curing chronic diseases.29. What should be the priority of ’s health-care system according to the author?A) To resolve the dilemma in the health-care system.B) To maintain ’s lead in the drug industry.C) To allow the vast majority to enjoy its benefits.D) To quicken the pace of new drug development.30. What are American drug companies doing to protect their high profits?A) Labeling drugs bought from  as being fakes.B) Threatening to cut back funding for new drug research.C) Reducing supplies to uncooperative Canadian pharmacies.D) Attributing the raging epidemics to the ineffectiveness of Canadian drugs.Passage ThreeQuestions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.　　Age has its privileges in . And one of the more prominent of them is the senior citizen discount. Anyone who has reached a certain age-in some cases as low as 55-is automatically entitled to a dazzling array of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life. Eligibility is determined not by one’s need but by the date on one’s birth certificate. Practically unheard of a generation ago, the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses-as common as color televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners.　　People with gray hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them；yet，millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent (有支付能力的). Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans. The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that “elderly” and “needy” are synonymous (同义的). 　　Perhaps that once was true, but today elderly Americans as a group have a lower poverty rate than the rest of the population. To be sure, there is economic diversity within the elderly, and many older Americans are poor, But most of them aren’t. It is impossible to determine the impact of the discounts on individual companies. For many firms, they are a stimulus to revenue. But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense. 　　Directly or indirectly, of younger Americans. Moreover, they are a direct irritant in what some politicians and scholars see as a coming conflict between the generations.　　Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits，which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old. Employment is another sore point, Buoyed (支持) by laws and court decisions, more and more older Americans are declining the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job-thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers.　　Far from a kind of charity they once were, senior citizen discounts have become a formidable economic privilege to a group with millions of members who don’t need them.　　It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others. Senior citizen discounts only enhance the myth that older people can’t take care of themselves and need special treatment； and they threaten the creation of a new myth, that the elderly are ungrateful and taking for themselves at the expense of children and other age groups. Senior citizen discounts are the essence of the very thing older Americans are fighting against-discrimination by age.31. We learn from the first paragraph that____.A) offering senior citizens discounts has become routine commercial practiceB) senior citizen discounts have enabled many old people to live a decent lifeC) giving senior citizens discounts has boosted the market for the elderlyD) senior citizens have to show their birth certificates to get a discount32. What assumption lies behind the practice of senior citizen discounts?A) Businesses, having made a lot of profits, should do something for society in return.B) Old people are entitled to special treatment for the contribution they made to society.C) The elderly, being financially underprivileged，need humane help from society.D) Senior citizen discounts can make up for the inadequacy of the Social Security system.33. According to some politicians and scholars, senior citizen discounts will___.A) make old people even more dependent on societyB) intensify conflicts between the young and the oldC) have adverse financial impact on business companiesD) bring a marked increase in the companies revenues34. How does the author view the Social Security system?A) It encourages elderly people to retire in time.B) It opens up broad career prospects for young people.C) It benefits the old at the expense of the youngD) It should be reinforced by laws and court decisions35. Which of the following best summarizes the author’s main argument?A) Senior citizens should fight hard against age discrimination.B) The elderly are selfish and taking senior discounts for granted.C) Priority should be given to the economic needs of senior citizens.D) Senior citizen discounts may well be a type of age discrimination.Passage FourQuestions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.　　In 1854 my great-grandfather, Morris Marable, was sold on an auction block in  for ＄500. For his white slave master, the sale was just “business as usual.” But to Morris Marable and his heirs, slavery was a crime against our humanity. This pattern of human rights violations against enslaved African-Americans continued under racial segregation for nearly another century.The fundamental problem of American democracy in the 21st century is the problem of “structural racism” the deep patterns of socio-economic inequality and accumulated disadvantage that are coded by race, and constantly justified in public speeches by both racist stereotypes and white indifference. Do Americans have the capacity and vision to remove these structural barriers that deny democratic rights and opportunities to millions of their fellow citizens?　　This country has previously witnessed two great struggles to achieve a truly multicultural democracy.　　The First Reconstruction (1865-1877) ended slavery and briefly gave black men voting rights, but gave no meaningful compensation for two centuries of unpaid labor. The promise of “40 acres and a mule (骡子)”was for most blacks a dream deferred (尚未实现的).　　The Second Reconstruction (1954-1968), or the modern civil rights movement, ended legal segregation in public accommodations and gave blacks voting rights . But these successes paradoxically obscure the tremendous human costs of historically accumulated disadvantage that remain central to black Americans’ lives.　　The disproportionate wealth that most whites enjoy today was first constructed from centuries of unpaid black labor. Many white institutions, including some leading universities, insurance companies and banks, profited from slavery. This pattern of white privilege and black inequality continues today.　　Demanding reparations (赔偿) is not just about compensation for slavery and segregation. It is, more important, an educational campaign to highlight the contemporary reality of “racial deficits” of all kinds, the unequal conditions that impact blacks regardless of class. Structural racism’s barriers include “equity inequity.” the absence of black capital formation that is a direct consequence of ’s history. One third of all black households actually have negative net wealth. In 1998 the typical black family’s net wealth was ＄16,400, less than one fifth that of white families.　　Black families are denied home loans at twice the rate of whites.　　Blacks remain the last hired and first fired during recessions. 　　During the 1990-91 recession. African-Americans suffered disproportionately. At Coca-Cola, 42 percent of employees who lost their jobs were blacks. At Sears, 54 percent were black, Blacks have significantly shorter life spans, in part due to racism in the health establishment. Blacks are statistically less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or early-stage cancer surgery.36. To the author, the auction of his great-grandfather is a typical example of____.A) crime against humanityB) unfair business transactionC) racial conflicts in D) racial segregation in 37. The barrier to democracy in 21st century  is____.A) widespread use of racist stereotypesB) prejudice against minority groupsC) deep-rooted socio-economic inequalityD) denial of legal rights to ordinary blacks38. What problem remains unsolved in the two Reconstructions?A) Differences between races are deliberately obscured.B) The blacks are not compensated for their unpaid labor.C) There is no guarantee for blacks to exercise their rights.D) The interests of blacks are not protected by law.39. It is clear that the wealth enjoyed by most whites____.A) has resulted from business successes over the yearsB) has been accompanied by black capital formationC) has derived from sizable investments in educationD) has been accumulated from generations of slavery40. What does the author think of the current situation regarding racial discrimination?A) Racism is not a major obstacle to blacks’ employment.B) Inequality of many kinds remains virtually untouchedC) A major step has been taken towards reparations.D) Little has been done to ensure blacks’ civil rights.Part III Vocabulary (20 minutes)Direction: There are 30 incomplete sentences in this part.

Seven Ways to Save the WorldForget the old idea that conserving energy is a form of self-denial — riding bicycles, dimming the lights, and taking fewer showers. These days conservation is all about efficiency: getting the same — or better — results from just a fraction of the energy. When a slump in business travel forced Ulrich Rǒmer to cut cost costs at his family-owned hotel in , he replaced hundreds of the hotel’s wasteful light bulbs, getting the same light for 80 percent less power. He bought a new water boiler with a digitally controlled pump, and wrapped insulation around the pipes. Spending about € 100,000 on these and other improvements, he slashed his € 90,000 fuel and power bill by € 60,000. As a bonus, the hotel’s lower energy needs have reduced its annual carbon emissions by more than 200 metric tons. “For us, saving energy has been very, very profitable,” he says. “And most importantly, we’re not giving up a single comfort for our guests.”     Efficiency is also a great way to lower carbon emissions and help slow global warming. But the best argument for efficiency is its cost — or, more precisely, its profitability. That’s because quickly growing energy demand requires immense investment in new supply, not to mention the drain of rising energy prices.     No wonder efficiency has moved to the top of the political agenda. On Jan. 10, the European Union unveiled a plan to cut energy use across the continent by 20 percent by 2020. Last March,  imposed a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2020. Even George W. Bush, the  oilman, is expected to talk about energy conversation in his State of the Union speech this week.     The good news is that the world is full of proven, cheap ways to save energy. Here are the seven that could have the biggest impact:Insulate Space heating and cooling eats up 36 percent of all the world’s energy. There’s virtually no limit to how much of that can be saved, as prototype “zero-energy homes” in  and  have shown. There’s been a surge in new ways of keeping heat in and cold out (or vice versa). The most advanced insulation follows the law of increasing returns: if you add enough, you can scale down or even eliminate heating and air-conditioning equipment, lowering costs even before you start saving on utility bills. Studies have shown that green workplaces (ones that don’t constantly need to have the heat or air-conditioner running) have higher worker productivity and lower sick rates.Change BulbsLighting eats up 20 percent of the world’s electricity, or the equivalent of roughly 600,000 tons of coal a day. Forty percent of that powers old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs — a 19th-century technology that wastes most of the power it consumes on unwanted heat.Compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, not only use 75 to 80 percent less electricity than incandescent bulbs to generate the same amount of light, but they also last 10 times longer. Phasing old bulbs out by 2030 would save the output of 650 power plants and avoid the release of 700 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year.Comfort Zone Water boilers, space heaters and air conditioners have been notoriously inefficient. The heat pump has altered that equation. It removes heat from the air outside or the ground below and uses it to supply heat to a building or its water supply. In the summer, the system can be reversed to cool building as well.Most new residential buildings in  are already heated with ground-source heat pumps. Such systems consume almost no conventional fuel at all. Several countries have used subsidies to jump-start the market, including , where almost 1 million heat pumps have been installed in the past two years to heat water for showers and hot tubs.
Remake Factories      From steel mills to paper factories, industry eats up about a third of the world’s energy. The opportunities to save are vast. In , German chemicals giant BASF runs an interconnected complex of more than 200 chemical factories, where heat produced by one chemical process is used to power the next. At the  site alone, such recycling of heat and energy saves the company € 200 million a year and almost half its CO2 emissions. Now BASF is doing the same for new plants in . “Optimizing (优化) energy efficiency is a decisive competitive advantage, ” says BASF CEO Jǔrgen Hambrecht.
Green Driving A quarter of the world’s energy — including two thirds of the annual production of oil — is used for transportation. Some savings come free of charge: you can boost fuel efficiency by 6 percent simply by keeping your car’s tires properly inflated (充气). Gasoline-electric hybrid (混合型) models like the Toyota Prius improve mileage by a further 20 percent over conventional models.A Better FridgeMore than half of all residential power goes into running household appliances，producing a fifth of the world’s carbon emissions. And that’s true even though manufacturers have already hiked the efficiency of refrigerators and other white goods by as much as 70 percent since the 1980s. According to an International Energy Agency study, if consumers chose those models that would save them the most money over the life of the appliance, they’d cut global residential power consumption and their utility bills by 43 percent.Flexible Payment      Who says you have to pay for all your conservation investment？“Energy service contractors” will pay for retrofitting (翻折改造) in return for a share of the client’s annual utility-bill savings. In , Shenwu Thermal Energy Technology Co. specializes in retrofitting ’s steel furnaces. Shenwu puts up the initial investment to install a heat exchanger that preheats the air going into the furnace，slashing the client’s fuel costs . Shenwu pockets a cut of those savings, so both Shenwu and the client profit.　　 If saving energy is so easy and profitable, why isn’t everyone doing it? It has to do with psychology and a lack of information. Most of us tend to look at today’s price tag more than tomorrow’s potential savings. That holds double for the landlord or developer, who won’t actually see a penny of the savings his investment in better insulation or a better heating system might generate. In many people’s minds, conservation is still associated with self-denial. Many environmentalists still push that view.Smart governments can help push the market in the right direction. The EU’s 1994 law on labeling was such a success that it extended the same idea to entire buildings last year. To boost the market value of efficiency, all new buildings are required to have an “energy pass” detailing power and heating consumption. Countries like  and  have successively tightened building codes, requiring an increase in insulation levels but leaving it up to builders to decide how to meet them.The most powerful incentives, of course, will come from the market itself. Over the past year, sky-high fuel prices have focused minds on efficiency like never before. Ever-increasing pressure to cut costs has finally forced more companies to do some math on their energy use.Will it be enough? With global demand and emissions rising so fast, we may not have any choice but to try. Efficient technology is here now, proven and cheap. Compared with all other options, it’s the biggest, easiest and most profitable bang for the buck.1. What is said to be the best way to conserve energy nowadays?[A] Raising efficiently.

Please write your answers on Answer sheet 2.Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.Men, these days, are embracing fatherhood with the round-the-clock involvement their partners have always dreamed of — handling night feedings, packing lunches and bandaging knees. But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information. “Men in my generation (aged 25-40) have a fear of becoming dads because we have no role models,” says Jon Smith, a writer. They often find themselves excluded from mothers’ support networks, and are eyed warily (警觉地) on the playground.The challenge is particularly evident in the work-place. There, men are still expected to be breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder: traditionally-minded bosses are often unsympathetic to family needs. In Denmark most new fathers only take two weeks of paternity leave (父亲的陪产假) — even though they are allowed 34 days. As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements.Though Wilfried-Fritz Maring, 54, a data-bank and Internet specialist with German firm FIZ , feels that the time he spends with his daughter outweighs any disadvantages, he admits, “With my decision to work from home I dismissed any opportunity for promotion.”Mind-sets (思维定势) are changing gradually. When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to choose a job that could be performed from there. Danish telecom company TDC initiated an internal campaign last year to encourage dads to take paternity leave: 97 percent now do. “When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training: in how to keep cool under stress.” says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. For a new generation of dads, kids may come before the company － but it’s a shift that benefits both.47. Unlike women, men often get little support or information from          .48. Besides supporting the family, men were also expected to          .49. Like women, men hope that their desire for a flexible schedule will be          .50. When Maring was on paternity leave, he was allowed by his company to work         . 51. Christine Holm believes paternity leave provides a new kind of training for men in that it can help them cope with          .Section B Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.Like most people, I’ve long understood that I will be judged by my occupation, that my profession is a gauge people use to see how smart or talented I am. Recently, however, I was disappointed to see that it also decides how I’m treated as a person.Last year I left a professional position as a small-town reporter and took a job waiting tables. As someone paid to serve food to people. I had customers say and do things to me I suspect they’d never say or do to their most casual acquaintances. One night a man talking on his cell phone waved me away, then beckoned (示意) me back with his finger minute later, complaining he was ready to order and asking where I’d been.I had waited tables during summers in college and was treated like a peon (勤杂工) plenty of people. But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. Besides, people responded to me differently after I told them I was in college. Customers would joke that one day I’d be sitting at their table, waiting to be served.Once I graduated I took a job at a community newspaper. From my first day, I heard a respectful tone from everyone who called me. I assumed this was the way the professional world worked — cordially.I soon found out differently. I sat several feet away from an advertising sales representative with a similar name. Our calls would often get mixed up and someone asking for Kristen would be transferred to Christie. The mistake was immediately evident. Perhaps it was because money was involved, but people used a tone with Kristen that they never used with me.My job title made people treat me with courtesy. So it was a shock to return to the restaurant industry.It’s no secret that there’s a lot to put up with when waiting tables, and fortunately, much of it can be easily forgotten when you pocket the tips. The service industry, by definition, exists to cater to others’ needs. Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant.I’m now applying to graduated school, which means someday I’ll return to a profession where people need to be nice to me in order to get what they want, I think I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them.52. The author was disappointed to find that _______.[A] one’s position is used as a gauge to measure one’s intelligence[B] talented people like her should fail to get a respectable job[C] one’s occupation affects the way one is treated as a person[D] professionals tend to look down upon manual workers53. What does the author intend to say by the example in the second paragraph?[A] Some customers simply show no respect to those who serve them.[B] People absorbed in a phone conversation tend to be absent-minded.[C] Waitresses are often treated by customers as casual acquaintances.[D] Some customers like to make loud complaints for no reason at all.54. How did the author feel when waiting tables at the age of 19?[A] She felt it unfair to be treated as a mere servant by professional.[B] She felt badly hurt when her customers regarded her as a peon.[C] She was embarrassed each time her customers joked with her.[D] She found it natural for professionals to treat her as inferior.55. What does the author imply by saying “…many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant”(Lines 3-4, Para.7)?[A] Those who cater to others’ needs are destined to be looked down upon.[B] Those working in the service industry shouldn’t be treated as servants.[C] Those serving others have to put up with rough treatment to earn a living.[D] The majority of customers tend to look on a servant as server nowadays.56. The author says she’ll one day take her clients to dinner in order to ________.[A] see what kind of person they are[B] experience the feeling of being served[C] show her generosity towards people inferior to her[D] arouse their sympathy for people living a humble lifePassage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.What’s hot for 2007 among the very rich? A $7.3million diamond ring. A trip to  to hunt wild animals. Oh, and income inequality.Sure, some leftish billionaires like George Soros have been railing against income inequality for years. But increasingly, centrist and right-wing billionaires are staring to worry about income inequality and the fate of the middle class.In December, Mortimer Zuckerman wrote a column in U.S. News & World Report, which he owns. “our nation’s core bargain with the middle class is disintegrating,” lamented (哀叹) the 117th-richest man in America. “Most of our economic gains have gone to people at the very top of the income ladder. Average income for a household of people of working age, by contrast, has fallen five years in a raw.” He noted that “Tens of millions of Americans live in fear that a major health problem can reduce them to bankruptcy.”Wilbur Ross Jr. has echoed Zuckerman’s anger over the bitter struggles faced by middle-class Americans. “It’s an outrage that any American’s life expectancy should be shortened simply because the company they worked for went bankrupt and ended health-care coverage,” said the former chairman of the International Steel Group.What’s happening? The very rich are just as trendy as you and I, and can be so when it comes to politics and policy. Given the recent change of control in Congress, the popularity of measures like increasing the minimum wage, and efforts by California’s governor to offer universal health care, these guys don’t need their own personal weathermen to know which way the wind blows.It’s possible that plutocrats (有钱有势的人) are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory (没收性的) tax policies. But the prospect that income inequality will lead to higher taxes on the wealthy doesn’t keep plutocrats up at night. They can live with that.No, what they fear was that the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the  because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity.In other words, if middle-class Americans continue to struggle financially as the ultrawealthy grow ever wealthier, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain political support for the free flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. And when the  places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. For people who buy and sell companies, or who allocate capital to markets all around the world, that’s the real nightmare.57. What is the current topic of common interest among the very rich in ?   [A] The fate of the ultrawealthy people.   [B] The disintegration of the middle class.   [C] The inequality in the distribution of wealth.   [D] The conflict between the left and the right wing.58. What do we learn from Mortimer Zuckerman’s lamentation?   [A] Many middle-income families have failed to make a bargain for better welfare.   [B] The American economic system has caused companies to go bankrupt.[C] The American nation is becoming more and more divided despite its wealth.[D] The majority of Americans benefit little from the nation’s growing wealth.59. From the fifth paragraph we can learn that ________.   [A] the very rich are fashion-conscious   [B] the very rich are politically sensitive   [C] universal health care is to be implemented throughout    [D] Congress has gained popularity by increasing the minimum wage60. What is the real reason for plutocrats to express solidarity with the middle class?   [A] They want to protect themselves from confiscatory taxation.   [B] They know that the middle class contributes most to society.   [C] They want to gain support for global economic integration.   [D] They feel increasingly threatened by economic insecurity.61. What may happen if the  places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods?   [A] The prices of imported goods will inevitably soar beyond control.   [B] The investors will have to make great efforts to re-allocate capital.   [C] The wealthy will attempt to buy foreign companies across borders.   [D]. Foreign countries will place the same economic barriers in return.Part V 								Cloze         				（15 minutes）Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

Supersize SurpriseAsk anyone why there is an obesity epidemic and they will tell you that it’s al down to eating too much and burning too few calories. That explanation appeals to common sense and has dominated efforts to get to the root of the obesity epidemic and reverse it. Yet obesity researchers are increasingly dissatisfied with it. Many now believe that something else must have changed in our environment to precipitate(促成) such dramatic rises in obesity over the past 40 years or so. Nobody is saying that the “big two” – reduced physical activity and increased availability of food – are not important contributors to the epidemic, but they cannot explain it all.Earlier this year a review paper by 20obesity experts set out the 7 most plausible alternative explanations for the epidemic. Here they are.1.Not enough sleep It is widely believed that sleep is for the brain, not the body. Could a shortage of shut-eye also be helping to make us fat?Several large-scale studies suggest there may be a link. People who sleep less than 7 hours a night tend to have a higher body mass index than people who sleep more, according to data gathered by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Similarly, the US Nurses’ Health Study, which tracked 68,000 women for 16 years, found that those who slept an average of 5 hours a night gained more weight during the study period than women who slept 6 hours, who in turn gained more than whose who slept 7.It’s well known that obesity impairs sleep, so perhaps people get fat first and sleep less afterwards. But the nurses’ study suggests that it can work in the other direction too: sleep loss may precipitate weight gain.Although getting figures is difficult, it appears that we really are sleeping less. In 1960 people in the  slept an average of 8.5 hours per night. A 2002 poll by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that the average has fallen to under 7 hours, and the decline is mirrored by the increase in obesity.2. Climate controlWe humans, like all warm-blooded animals, can keep our core body temperatures pretty much constant regardless of what’s going on in the world around us. We do this by altering our metabolic(新陈代谢的) rate, shivering or sweating. Keeping warm and staying cool take energy unless we are in the “thermo-neutral zone”, which is increasingly where we choose to live and work.    There is no denying that ambient temperatures(环境温度) have changed in the past few decades. Between 1970 and 2000, the average British home warmed from a chilly  to . In the , the changes have been at the other end of the thermometer as the proportion of homes with air conditioning rose from 23% to 47% between 1978 and 1997. In the southern states – where obesity rates tend to be highest – the number of houses with air conditioning has shot up to 71% from 37% in 1978.Could air conditioning in summer and heating in winter really make a difference to our weight?Sadly，there is some evidence that it does-at least with regard to heating. Studies show that in comfortable temperatures we use less energy.3. Less smoking Bad news: smokers really do tend to be thinner than the rest of us, and quitting really does pack on the pounds, though no one is sure why. It probably has something to do with the fact that nicotine is an appetite suppressant and appears to up your metabolic rate. Katherine Flegal and colleagues at the US National Center for Health Statistics in , , have calculated that people kicking the habit have been responsible for a small but significant portion of the  epidemic of fatness. From data collected around 1991 by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, they worked out that people who had quit in the previous decade were much more likely to be overweight than smokers and people who had never smoked .Among men, for example, nearly half of quitters were overweight compared with 37% of non-smokers and only 28%of smokers.4. Genetic effects Yours chances of becoming fat may be set, at least in part, before you were even born. Children of obese mothers are much more likely to become obese themselves later in life. Offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet during pregnancy are much more likely to become fat than the offspring of identical mice fed a normal diet. Intriguingly, the effect persists for two or three generations. Grandchildren of mice fed a high-fat diet grow up fat even if their own mother is fed normally-so you fate may have been sealed even before you were conceived.5. A little older…Some groups of people just happen to be fatter than others. Surveys carried out by the  national center for health statistics found that adults aged 40 to 79 were around three times as likely to be obese as younger people. Non-white females also tend to fall at the fatter end of the spectrum: Mexican-American women are 30% more likely than white women to be obsess, and black women have twice the risk.    In the , these groups account for an increasing percentage of the population. Between 1970 and 2000 the US population aged 35 to 44 grew by43%.the proportion of Hispanic-Americans also grew, from under 5% to 12.5% of the population, while the proportion of black Americans increased from 11% to12.3%.these changes may account in part for the increased prevalence of obesity.6. Mature mums     Mothers around the world are getting older. in the UK, the mean age for having a first child is 27.3,compared with  1970 .mean age at first birth in the US has also increased, rising from  1970 to  2000.    This would be neither here nor there if it weren’t for the observation that having an older mother seems to be an independent risk factor for obesity. Results from the  national heart, lung and blood institute’s study found that the odds of a child being obese increase 14% for every five extra years of their mother’s age, though why this should be so is not entirely clear.Michael Symonds at the University of Nottingham, UK, found that first-born children have more fat than younger ones. As family size decreases, firstborns account for a greater share of the population. In 1964, British women gave birth to an average of 2.95 children; by 2005 that figure had fallen to 1.79. In the  in1976, 9.6% of woman in their 40s had only one child; in 2004 it was 17.4%. this combination of older mothers and more single children could be contributing to the obesity epidemic.7. Like marrying like Just as people pair off according to looks, so they do for size. Lean people are more likely to marry lean and fat more likely to marry fat. On its own, like marrying like cannot account for any increase in obesity. But combined with others—particularly the fact that obesity is partly genetic, and that heavier people have more children—it amplifies the increase form other causes.1.

Please write your answers on Answer sheet 2.Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.    One of the major producers of athletic footwear, with 2002 sales of over $10 billion, is a company called Nike, with corporate headquarters in . Forbes magazine identified Nike’s president, Philip Knight, as the 53rd-richestman in the world in 2004. But Nike has not always been a large multimillion-dollar organization. In fact, Knight started the company by selling shoes from the back of his car at track meets.In the late1950s Philip Knight was a middle-distance runner on the  track team, coached by Bill Bowerman. One of the top track coaches in the , Bowerman was also known for experimenting with the design of running shoes in an attempt to make them lighter and more shock-absorbent. After attending , Knight moved on to do graduate work at ; his MBA thesis was on marketing athletic shoes. Once he received his degree, Knight traveled to  to contact the Onitsuka Tiger Company, a manufacturer of athletic shoes. Knight convinced the company’s officials of the potential for its product in the  In 1963 he received his first shipment of Tiger shoes, 200 pairs in total.In 1964, Knight and Bowerman contributed $500 each to from Blue Ribbon Sports, the predecessor of Nike. In the first few years, Knight distributed shoes out of his car at local track meets. The first employees hired by Knight were former college athletes. The company did not have the money to hire “experts”, and there was no established athletic footwear industry in  from which to recruit those knowledgeable in the field. In its early years the organization operated in an unconventional manner that characterized its innovative and entrepreneurial approach to the industry. Communication was informal; people discussed ideas and issues in the hallways, on a run, or over a beer. There was little task differentiation. There were no job descriptions, rigid reporting systems, or detailed rules and regulations. The team spirit and shared values of the athletes on Bowerman’s teams carried over and provided the basis for the collegial style of management that characterized the early years of Nikes.47. While serving as a track coach, Bowerman tried to design running shoes that were _____________________.48.

You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.Sustainable development is applied to just about everything from energy to clean water and economic growth, and as a result it has become difficult to question either the basic assumptions behind it or the way the concept is put to use. This is especially true in agriculture, where sustainable development is often taken as the sole measure of progress without a proper appreciation of historical and cultural perspectives.To start with, it is important to remember that the nature of agriculture has changed markedly throughout history, and will continue to do so .medieval agriculture in northern  fed, clothed and sheltered a predominantly rural society with a much lower population density than it is today. It had minimal effect on biodiversity, and any pollution it caused was typically localized. In terms of energy use and the nutrients（营养成分）captured in the product it was relatively inefficient.Contrast this with farming since the start of the industrial revolution. Competition from overseas led farmers to specialize and increase yields. Throughout this period food became cheaper, safe and more reliable. However, these changes have also led to habitat（栖息地）loss and to diminishing biodiversity.What’s more, demand for animal products in developing countries is growing so fast that meeting it will require an extra 300 million tons of grain a year by 2050.yet the growth of cities and industry is reducing the amount of water available for agriculture in many regions.All this means that agriculture in the 21stcentury will have to be very different from how it was in the 20th.thiswill require radical thinking. For example, we need to move away from the idea that traditional practices are inevitably more sustainable than new ones. We also need to abandon the notion that agriculture can be “zero impact”. The key will be to abandon the rather simple and static measures of sustainability, which centre on the need to maintain production without increasing damage.Instead we need a more dynamic interpretation, one that looks at the pros and cons（正反两方面）of all the various way land is used. There are many different ways to measure agricultural performance besides food yield: energy use, environmental costs, water purity, carbon footprint and biodiversity. It is clear, for example, that the carbon of transporting tomatoes from  to the  is less than that of producing them in the  with additional heating and lighting. But we do not know whether lower carbon footprints will always be better for biodiversity.What is crucial is recognizing that sustainable agriculture is not just about sustainable food production.52. How do people often measure progress in agriculture?   A) By its productivity   C) By its impact on the environment   B) By its sustainability  D) By its contribution to economic growth53. Specialisation and the effort to increase yields have resulted in________.   A) Localised pollution      C) competition from overseas   B) the shrinking of farmland  D) the decrease of biodiversity54. What does the author think of traditional farming practices?  A) They have remained the same over the centuries  B) They have not kept pace with population growth  C) They are not necessarily sustainable  D) They are environmentally friendly55. What will agriculture be like in the 21st century  A) It will go through radical changes  B) It will supply more animal products  C) It will abandon traditional farming practices  D) It will cause zero damage to the environment56 What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage?  A) To remind people of the need of sustainable development  B) To suggest ways of ensuring sustainable food production  C) To advance new criteria for measuring farming progress  D) To urge people to rethink what sustainable agriculture isPassage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.The percentage of immigrants (including those unlawfully present) in the  has been creeping upward for years. At 12.6 percent, it is now higher than at any point since the mid1920s.   We are not about to go back to the days when Congress openly worried about inferior races polluting ’s bloodstream. But once again we are wondering whether we have too many of the wrong sort newcomers. Their loudest critics argue that the new wave of immigrants cannot, and indeed do not want to, fit in as previous generations did. We now know that these racist views were wrong. In time, Italians, Romanians and members of other so-called inferior races became exemplary Americans and contributed greatly, in ways too numerous to detail, to the building of this magnificent nation. There is no reason why these new immigrants should not have the same success. Although children of Mexican immigrants do better, in terms of educational and professional attainment, than their parents UCLA sociologist Edward Telles has found that the gains don’t continue. Indeed, the fouth generation is marginally worse off than the third James Jackson, of the University of Michigan, has found a similar trend among black Caribbean immigrants, Tells fears that Mexican-Americans may be fated to follow in the footsteps of American blacks-that large parts of the community may become mired（陷入）in a seemingly  permanent state of poverty and Underachievement. Like African-Americans, Mexican-Americans are increasingly relegated to (降入)segregated, substandard schools, and their dropout rate is the highest for any  ethnic group in the country. We have learned much about the foolish idea of excluding people on the presumption of the ethnic/racial inferiority. But what we have not yet learned is how to make the process of Americanization work for all. I am not talking about requiring people to learn English or to adopt American ways; those things happen pretty much on their own, but as arguments about immigration hear up the campaign trail, we also ought to ask some broader question about assimilation, about how to ensure that people , once outsiders , don’t forever remain marginalized within these shores.     That is a much larger question than what should happen with undocumented workers, or how best to secure the border, and it is one that affects not only newcomers but groups that have been here for generations. It will have more impact on our future than where we decide to set the admissions bar for the latest ware of would-be Americans. And it would be nice if we finally got the answer right.57. How were immigrants viewed by  Congress in early days?A) They were of inferior races.B) They were a Source of political corruption.C) They were a threat to the nation’s security.D) They were part of the nation’s bloodstream.58. What does the author think of the new immigrants?A) They will be a dynamic work force in the B) They can do just as well as their predecessors.C) They will be very disappointed on the new land.D) They may find it hard to fit into the mainstream.59. What does Edward Telles’ research say about Mexican-Americans?A) They may slowly improve from generation to generation.B) They will do better in terms of educational attainment.C) They will melt into the African-American community.D) They may forever remain poor and underachieving.60. What should be done to help the new immigrants?A) Rid them of their inferiority complex.B) Urge them to adopt American customs.C) Prevent them from being marginalized.D) Teach them standard American English.61.

For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.Bosses Say “Yes” to Home WorkRising costs of office space, time lost to stressful commuting, and a slow recognition that workers have lives beyond the office—all are strong arguments for letting staff work from home.For the small business, there are additional benefits too—staff are more productive, and happier, enabling firms to keep their headcounts (员工数) and their recruitment costs to a minimum. It can also provide competitive advantage, especially when small businesses want to attract new staff but don’t have the budget to offer huge salaries.While company managers have known about the benefits for a long time, many have done little about it, sceptical of whether they could trust their employees to work to full capacity without supervision, or concerned about the additional expenses teleworking policies might incur as staff start charging their home phone bills to the business.Yet this is now changing. When communications provider Inter-Tel researched the use of remote working solutions among small-and-medium-sized  businesses in April this year, it found that 28% more companies claimed to have introduced flexible working practices than a year ago.The UK network of Business Links confirms that it too has seen a growing interest in remote working solutions from small businesses seeking its advice, and claims that as many as 60-70% of the businesses that come through its doors now offer some form of remote working support to their workforces.Technology advances, including the widespread availability of broadband, are making the introduction of remote working a piece of cake.“If systems are set up properly, staff can have access to all the resources they have in the office wherever they have an internet connection,” says Andy Poulton, e-business advisor at Business Link for  and Wiltshire. “There are some very exciting developments which have enabled this.”One is the availability of broadband everywhere, which now covers almost all of the country (BT claims that, by July, 99.8% of its exchanges will be broadband enabled, with alternative plans in place for even the most remote exchanges). “This is the enabler,” Poulton says.Yet while broadband has come down in price too, those service providers targeting the business market warn against consumer services masquerading (伪装) as business-friendly broadband.“Broadband is available for as little as ￡ month, but many businesses fail to appreciate the hidden costs of such a service,” says Neil Stephenson, sales and marketing director at Onyx Internet, an internet service provider based in the north-east of England. “Providers offering broadband for rock-bottom prices are notorious for poor service, with regular breakdowns and heavily congested (拥堵的) networks. It is always advisable for businesses to look beyond the price tag and look for a business-only provider that can offer more reliability, with good support.” Such services don’t cost too much—quality services can be found for upwards of ￡ month.The benefits of broadband to the occasional home worker are that they can access email in real time, and take full advantage of services such as internet-based backup or even internet-based phone services.Internet-based telecoms, or VoIP (Voice over IP) to give it its technical title, is an interesting tool to any business supporting remote working. Not necessarily because of the promise of free or reduced price phone calls (which experts point out is misleading for the average business), but because of the sophisticated voice services that can be exploited by the remote worker—facilities such as voicemail and call forwarding, which provide a continuity of the company image for customers and business partners.By law, companies must “consider seriously” requests to work flexibly made by a parent with a child under the age of six, or a disabled child under 18. It was the need to accommodate employees with young children that motivated accountancy firm Wright Vigar to begin promoting teleworking recently. The company, which needed to upgrade its IT infrastructure (基础设施) to provide connectivity with a new, second office, decided to introduce support for remote working at the same time.Marketing director Jack O’Hern explains that the company has a relatively young workforce, many of whom are parents: “One of the triggers was when one of our tax managers returned from maternity leave. She was intending to work part time, but could only manage one day a week in the office due to childcare. By offering her the ability to work from home, we have doubled her capacity—now she works a day a week from home, and a day in the office. This is great for her, and for us as we retain someone highly qualified.”For Wright Vigar, which has now equipped all of its fee-earners to be able to work at maximum productivity when away from the offices (whether that’s from home, or while on the road), this strategy is not just about saving on commute time or cutting them loose from the office, but enabling them to work more flexible hours that fit around their home life.O’Hern says: “Although most of our work is client-based and must fit around this, we can’t see any reason why a parent can’t be on hand to deal with something important at home, if they have the ability to complete a project later in the day.”Supporting this new way of working came with a price, though. Although the firm was updating its systems anyway, the company spent 10-15% more per user to equip them with a laptop rather than a PC, and about the same to upgrade to a server that would enable remote staff to connect to the company networks and access all their usual resources.Although Wright Vigar hasn’t yet quantified the business benefits, it claims that, in addition to being able to retain key staff with young families, it is able to save fee-earners a substantial amount of “dead” time in their working days.That staff can do this without needing a fixed telephone line provides even more efficiency savings. “With Wi-Fi (fast, wireless internet connections) popping up all over the place, even on trains, our fee-earners can be productive as they travel, and between meetings, instead of having to kill time at the shops,” he adds.The company will also be able to avoid the expense of having to relocate staff to temporary offices for several weeks when it begins disruptive office renovations soon.Financial recruitment specialist Lynne Hargreaves knows exactly how much her firm has saved by adopting a teleworking strategy, which has involved handing her company’s data management over to a remote hosting company, Datanet, so it can be accessible by all the company’s consultants over broadband internet connections.It has enabled the company to dispense with its business premises altogether, following the realisation that it just didn’t need them any more. “The main motivation behind adopting home working was to increase my own productivity, as a single mum to an 11-year-old,” says Hargreaves. “But I soon realised that, as most of our business is done on the phone, email and at off-site meetings, we didn’t need our offices at all. We’re now saving ￡ year on rent, plus the cost of utilities, not to mention what would have been spent on commuting.”1.

When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.The ancient Greeks developed basic memory systems called mnemonics. The name is  from their Goddess of memory “Mnemosyne”. In the ancient world, a trained memory was an  asset, particularly in public life. There were no  devices for taking notes, and early Greek orators(演说家) delivered long speeches with great  because they learned the speeches using mnemonic systems.The Greeks discovered that human memory is  an associative process—that it works by linking things together. For example, think of an apple. The   your brain registers the word “apple”, it  the shape, color, taste, smell and  of that fruit. All these things are associated in your memory with the word “apple”.. An example could be when you think about a lecture you have had. This could trigger a memory about what you’re talking about through that lecture, which can then trigger another memory.. An example given on a website I was looking at follows: Do you remember the shape of , , , or ? Probably not. What about , though? . You made an association with something already known, the shape of a boot, and ’s shape could not be forgotten once you had made the association.PartⅣ Reading Comprehension(Reading in Depth)(25 minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.Many countries have made it illegal to chat into a hand-held mobile phone while driving. But the latest research further confirms that the danger lies less in what a motorist’s hands do when he takes a call than in what the conversation does to his brain. Even using a “hands-free” device can divert a driver’s attention to an alarming extent.Melina Kunar of the  of , and Todd Horowitz of the  ran a series of experiments in which two groups of volunteers had to pay attention and respond to a series of moving tasks on a computer screen that were reckoned equivalent in difficulty to driving. One group was left undistracted while the other had to engage in a conversation using a speakerphone. As Kunar and Horowitz report, those who were making the equivalent of a hands-free call had an average reaction time 212 milliseconds slower than those who were not. That, they calculate, would add 5.7 metres to the braking distance of a car travelling at 100kph. They also found that the group using the hands-free kit made 83% more errors in their tasks than those who were not talking.To try to understand more about why this was, they tried two further tests. In one, members of a group were asked simply to repeat words spoken by the caller. In the other, they had to think of a word that began with the last letter of the word they had just heard. Those only repeating words performed the same as those with no distraction, but those with the more complicated task showed even worse reaction times—an average of 480 milliseconds extra delay. This shows that when people have to consider the information they hear carefully, it can impair their driving ability significantly.Punishing people for using hand-held gadgets while driving is difficult enough, even though they can be seen from outside the car. Persuading people to switch their phones off altogether when they get behind the wheel might be the only answer. Who knows, they might even come to enjoy not having to take calls.47.	Carrying on a mobile phone conversation while one is driving is considered dangerous because it seriously distracts .48.	In the experiments, the two groups of volunteers were asked to handle a series of moving tasks which were considered .49.	Results of the experiments show that those who were making the equivalent of a hands-free call took  to react than those who were not.50.

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.There is nothing like the suggestion of a cancer risk to scare a parent, especially one of the over-educated, eco-conscious type. So you can imagine the reaction when a recent USA Today investigation of air quality around the nation’s schools singled out those in the smugly（自鸣得意的）green village of Berkeley, Calif., as being among the worst in the country. The city’s public high school, as well as a number of daycare centers, preschools, elementary and middle schools, fell in the lowest 10%. Industrial pollution in our town had supposedly turned students into living science experiments breathing in a laboratory’s worth of heavy metals like manganese, chromium and nickel each day. This in a city that requires school cafeterias to serve organic meals. Great, I thought, organic lunch, toxic campus.Since December, when the report came out, the mayor, neighborhood activists（活跃分子）and various parent-teacher associations have engaged in a fierce battle over its validity: over the guilt of the steel-casting factory on the western edge of town, over union jobs versus children’s health and over what, if anything, ought to be done. With all sides presenting their own experts armed with conflicting scientific studies, whom should parents believe? Is there truly a threat here, we asked one another as we dropped off our kids, and if so, how great is it? And how does it compare with the other, seemingly perpetual health scares we confront, like panic over lead in synthetic athletic fields? Rather than just another weird episode in the town that brought you protesting environmentalists, this latest drama is a trial for how today’s parents perceive risk, how we try to keep our kids safe—whether it’s possible to keep them safe—in what feels like an increasingly threatening world. It raises the question of what, in our time, “safe” could even mean.“There’s no way around the uncertainty,” says Kimberly Thompson, president of Kid Risk, a nonprofit group that studies children’s health. “That means your choices can matter, but it also means you aren’t going to know if they do.” A 2004 report in the journal Pediatrics explained that nervous parents have more to fear from fire, car accidents and drowning than from toxic chemical exposure. To which I say: Well, obviously. But such concrete hazards are beside the point. It’s the dangers parents can’t—and may never—quantify that occur all of sudden. That’s why I’ve rid my cupboard of microwave food packed in bags coated with a potential cancer-causing substance, but although I’ve lived blocks from a major fault line(地质断层) for more than 12 years, I still haven’t bolted our bookcases to the living room wall.52.	What does a recent investigation by USA Today reveal?A) Heavy metals in lab tests threaten children’s health in .B)  residents are quite contented with their surroundings.C) The air quality around ’s school campuses is poor.D) Parents in  are over-sensitive to cancer risks their kids face.53.

Of the dangers in everyday life, the author thinks that people have most to fear from __________.A) the uncertainB) the quantifiableC) an earthquake D) unhealthy foodPassage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.Crippling health care bills, long emergency-room waits and the inability to find a primary care physician just scratch the surface of the problems that patients face daily.Primary care should be the backbone of any health care system. Countries with appropriate primary care resources score highly when it comes to health outcomes and cost. The  takes the opposite approach by emphasizing the specialist rather than the primary care physician.A recent study analyzed the providers who treat Medicare beneficiaries（老年医保受惠人）. The startling finding was that the average Medicare patient saw a total of seven doctors—two primary care physicians and five specialists—in a given year. Contrary to popular belief, the more physicians taking care of you don’t guarantee better care. Actually, increasing fragmentation of care results in a corresponding rise in cost and medical errors.How did we let primary care slip so far? The key is how doctors are paid. Most physicians are paid whenever they perform a medical service. The more a physician does, regardless of quality or outcome, the better he’s reimbursed (返还费用). Moreover, the amount a physician receives leans heavily toward medical or surgical procedures. A specialist who performs a procedure in a 30-minute visit can be paid three times more than a primary care physician using that same 30 minutes to discuss a patient’s disease. Combine this fact with annual government threats to indiscriminately cut reimbursements, physicians are faced with no choice but to increase quantity to boost income.Primary care physicians who refuse to compromise quality are either driven out of business or to cash-only practices, further contributing to the decline of primary care.Medical students are not blind to this scenario. They see how heavily the reimbursement deck is stacked against primary care. The recent numbers show that since 1997, newly graduated  medical students who choose primary care as a career have declined by 50%. This trend results in emergency rooms being overwhelmed with patients without regular doctors.How do we fix this problem?It starts with reforming the physician reimbursement system. Remove the pressure for primary care physicians to squeeze in more patients per hour, and reward them for optimally (最佳地) managing their diseases and practicing evidence-based medicine. Make primary care more attractive to medical students by forgiving student loans for those who choose primary care as a career and reconciling the marked difference between specialist and primary care physician salaries.We’re at a point where primary care is needed more than ever. Within a few years, the first wave of the 76 million Baby Boomers will become eligible for Medicare. Patients older than 85, who need chronic care most, will rise by 50% this decade.Who will be there to treat them?57.	The author’s chief concern about the current  health care system is __________.A) the inadequate training of physiciansB) the declining number of doctorsC) the shrinking primary care resourcesD) the ever-rising health care costs58.	We learn from the passage that people tend to believe that __________.A) the more costly the medicine, the more effective the cureB) seeing more doctors may result in more diagnostic errorsC) visiting doctors on a regular basis ensures good healthD) the more doctors taking care of a patient, the better59.	Faced with the government threats to cut reimbursements indiscriminately, primary care physicians have to __________ .A) increase their income by working overtimeB) improve their expertise and serviceC) make various deals with specialistsD) see more patients at the expense of quality60.	Why do many new medical graduates refuse to choose primary care as their career?A) They find the need for primary care declining.B) The current system works against primary care.C) Primary care physicians command less respect.D) They think working in emergency rooms tedious.61.	What suggestion does the author give in order to provide better health care?A) Bridge the salary gap between specialists and primary care physicians.B) Extend primary care to patients with chronic diseases.C) Recruit more medical students by offering them loans.D) Reduce the tuition of students who choose primary care as their major.Part V Cloze (5 minutes)Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.　　Helicopter Moms vs. Free-Range KidsWould you let your fourth-grader ride public transportation without an adult? Probably not. Still, when Lenore Skenazy, a columnist for the New York Sun, wrote about letting her son take the subway alone to get back to "Long story short :my son got home from a department store on the Upper East Side, she didn’t expect to get hit with a wave of criticism from readers.　　“Long story short: My son got home, overjoyed with independence,” Skenazy wrote on April  the New York Sun. “Long story longer: Half the people I’ve told this episode to now want to turn on in for child abuse. As if keeping kids under lock and key and cell phone and careful watch is the right way to rear kids. It’s not. It’s debilitating (使虚弱)—for us and for them.”　　Online message boards were soon full of people both applauding and condemning Skenazy’s decision to let her son go it alone. She wound up defending herself on CNN (accompanied by her son) and on popular blogs like the buffing ton post, where her follow-up piece was ironically headlined “More From America’s Worst Mom.”　　The episode has ignited another one of those debates that divides parents into vocal opposing camps. Are Modern parents needlessly overprotective, or is the world a more complicated and dangerous place than it was when previous generations were allowed to wander about unsupervised? 　　From the “she’s an irresponsible mother” camp came: “Shame on you for being so careless about his safety,” in Comments on the buffing ton post. And there was this from a mother of four: “How would you have felt if he didn’t come home?” But Skenazy got a lot of support, too, with women and men writing in with stories about how they were allowed to take trips all by them selves at seven or eight. She also got heaps of praise for bucking the “helicopter parent” trend: “Good for this Mom,” one commenter wrote on the buffing ton post. “This is a much-needed reality check.”　　Last week, encouraged by all the attention, Skenazy started her own blog—Free Range, kids—promoting the idea that modern children need some of the same independence that her generation had. In the good old days nine-year-old baby boomers rode their bikes to school, walked to the store, took buses—and even subways—all by themselves. Her blog, she says, is dedicated to sensible parenting. “At Free Range Kids, we believe in safe kids. We believe in car seats and safety belts. We do NOT believe that every time school-age children go outside, they need a security guard.”　　So why are some parents so nervous about letting their children out of their sight? Are cities and towns less safe and kids more vulnerable to crimes like child kidnap and sexual abuse than they were in previous generations?　　Not exactly. , for instance, is safer than it’s ever been; it’s ranked 36th in crime among all American cities. Nationwide, stringer kidnaps are extremely rare; there’s a one-in-a-million chance a child will be taken by a stranger, according to the Justice Department. And 90 percent of sexual abuse cases are committed by someone the child knows. Mortality rates from all causes, including disease and accidents, for American children are lower now than they were 25 years’ ago. According to Child Trends, a nonprofit research group, between 1980 and 2003 death rates dropped by 44 percent for children aged 5 to 14 and 32 percent for teens aged 15 to 19.　　Then there’s the whole question of whether modern parents are more watchful and nervous about safety than previous generations. Yes, some are. Part of the problem is that with wall to wall Internet and cable news, every missing child case gets so much airtime that it’s not surprising even normal parental anxiety can be amplified. And many middle-class parents have gotten used to managing their children’s time and shuttling them to various enriching activities, so the idea of letting them out on their own can seem like a risk. Back in 1972, when many of today’s parents were kids, 87 percent of children who lived within a mile of school walked or biked every day. But today, the Centers for Disease Control report that only 13 percent of children bike, walk or otherwise t themselves to school.　　The extra supervision is both a city and a suburb phenomenon. Parents are worried about crime, and they are worried about kids getting caught in traffic in a city that’s not used to pedestrians. On the other hand, there are still plenty of kids whose parents give them a lot of independence, by choice or by necessity. The After School Alliance finds that more than 14 million kids aged 5 to 17 are responsible for taking care of themselves after school. Only 6.5 million kids participate in organized programs. “Many children who have working parents have to take the subway or bus to get to school. Many do this by themselves because they have no other way to get to the schools,” says Dr. Richard Gallagher, director of the Parenting Institute at the .　　For those parents who wonder how and when they should start allowing their kids more freedom, there’s no clear-cut answer. Child experts discourage a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. What’s right for Skenazy’s nine-year-old could be inappropriate for another one. It all depends on developmental issue, maturity, and the psychological and emotional makeup of that child. Several factors must be taken into account, says Gallagher. “The ability to follow parent guidelines, the child’s level of comfort in handling such situations, and a child’s general judgment should be weighed.”　　Gallagher agrees with Skenazy that many nine-year-olds are ready for independence like taking public transportation alone. “At certain times of the day, on certain routes, the subways are generally safe for these children, especially if they have grown up in the city and have been taught how to be safe, how to obtain help if they are concerned for their safety, and how to avoid unsafe situations by being watchful and on their toes.”　　But even with more traffic and fewer sidewalks, modern parents do have one advantage their parents didn’t: the cell phone. Being able to check in with a child anytime goes a long way toward relieving parental anxiety and may help parents loosen their control a little sooner. Skenazy got a lot of criticism because she didn’t give her kid her cell phone because she thought he’d lose it and wanted him to learn to go it alone without depending on mom—a major principle of free-range parenting. But most parents are more than happy to use cell phones to keep track of their kids.　　And for those who like the idea of free-range kids but still struggle with their inner helicopter parent, there may be a middle way. A new generation of GPS cell phones with tracking software make it easier than ever to follow a child’s every movement via the Internet—without seeming to interfere or hover. Of course, when they go to college, they might start objecting to being monitored as they’re on parole (假释).　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。　　1.

Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.　　Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.　　There is nothing new about TV and fashion magazines giving girls unhealthy ideas about how thin they need to be in order to be considered beautiful. What is surprising is the method psychologists at the  have come up with to keep girls from developing eating disorders. Their main weapon against super skinny (role) models: a brand of civil disobedience dubbed “body activism.”　　Since 2001, more than 1,000 high school and college students in the  have participated in the Body Project, which works by getting girls to understand how they have been buying into the notion that you have to be thin to be happy or successful. After critiquing (评论) the so-called thin ideal by writing essays and role-playing with their peers, participants are directed to come up with and execute small, nonviolent acts. They include slipping notes saying “Love your body the way it is” into dieting books at stores like Borders and writing letters to Mattel, makers of the impossibly proportioned Barbie doll.　　According to a study in the latest issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, the risk of developing eating disorders was reduced 61% among Body Project participants. And they continued to exhibit positive body-image attitudes as long as three years after completing the program, which consists, of four one-hour sessions. Such lasting effects may be due to girls’ realizing not only how they were being influenced but also who was benefiting from the societal pressure to be thin. “These people who promote the perfect body really don’t care about you at all,” says Kelsey Hertel, a high school junior and Body Project veteran in . “They purposefully make you feel like less of a person so you’ll buy their stuff and they’ll make money.”　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　47.

A formidable wall of bureaucracy has been erected to protect their prime nesting on the Atlantic coastlines. With all that attention paid to them, you’d think these creatures would at least have the gratitude not to go extinct.　　But Nature is indifferent to human notions of fairness, and a report by the Fish and Wildlife Service showed a worrisome drop in the populations of several species of  turtles, notably loggerheads, which can grow to as much as 400 pounds. The  nesting population, the largest, has declined by 50% in the last decade, according to Elizabeth Griffin, a marine biologist with the environmental group Oceana. The figures prompted Oceana to petition the government to upgrade the level of protection for the  loggerheads from “threatened” to “endangered”—meaning they are in danger of disappearing without additional help.　　Which raises the obvious question: what else do these turtles want from us, anyway? It turns out, according to Griffin, that while we have done a good job of protecting the turtles for the weeks they spend on land (as egg-laying females, as eggs and as hatchlings), we have neglected the years spend in the ocean. “The threat is from commercial fishing,” says . Trawlers (which drag large nets through the water and along the ocean floor) and long line fishers (which can deploy thousands of hooks on lines that can stretch for miles) take a heavy toll on turtles. 　　Of course, like every other environmental issue today, this is playing out against the background of global warming and human interference with natural ecosystems. The narrow strips of beach on which the turtles lay their eggs are being squeezed on one side by development and on the other by the threat of rising sea levels as the oceans warm. Ultimately we must get a handle on those issues as well, or a creature that outlived the dinosaurs (恐龙) will meet its end at the hands of humans, leaving our descendants to wonder how creature so ugly could have won so much affection.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　52. We can learn from the first paragraph that ________.　　A．human activities have changed the way turtles survive　　B．efforts have been made to protect turtles from dying out　　C．government bureaucracy has contributed to turtles’ extinction　　D．marine biologists are looking for the secret of turtles’ reproduction　　53. What does the author mean by “Nature is indifferent to human notions of fairness” (Line 1, Para. 2)?　　A．Nature is quite fair regarding the survival of turtles.　　B．Turtles are by nature indifferent to human activities.　　C．The course of nature will not be changed by human interference.　　D．The turtle population has decreased in spite of human protection.　　54. What constitutes a major threat to the survival of turtles according to Elizabeth Griffin?　　A．Their inadequate food supply.　　B．Unregulated commercial fishing.　　C．Their lower reproductively ability.　　D．Contamination of sea water　　55. How does global warming affect the survival of turtles?　　A．It threatens the sandy beaches on which they lay eggs.　　B．The changing climate makes it difficult for their eggs to hatch.　　C．The rising sea levels make it harder for their hatchlings to grow.　　D．It takes them longer to adapt to the high beach temperature.　　56. The last sentence of the passage is meant to ________.　　A．persuade human beings to show more affection for turtles　　B．stress that even the most ugly species should be protected　　C．call for effective measures to ensure sea turtles’ survival　　D．warn our descendants about the extinction of species　　Passage Two Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.　　There are few more sobering online activities than entering data into college-tuition calculators and gasping as the Web spits back a six-figure sum. But economists say families about to go into debt to fund four years of partying, as well as studying, can console themselves with the knowledge that college is an investment that, unlike many bank stocks, should yield huge dividends.　　A 2008 study by two Harvard economists notes that the “labor-market premium to skill”—or the amount college graduates earned that’s greater than what high-school graduate earned—decreased for much of the 20th century, but has come back with a vengeance (报复性地) since the 1980s. In 2005, The typical full-time year-round  worker with a four-year college degree earned $50,900, 62% more than the $31,500 earned by a worker with only a high-school diploma.　　There’s no question that going to college is a smart economic choice. But a look at the strange variations in tuition reveals that the choice about which college to attend doesn’t come down merely to dollars and cents. Does going to   (tuition, room and board $ 2007-08) yield a 40% greater return than attending the  of  at  as an out-of-state student ($35,542)? Probably not. Does being an out-of-state student at the  of  at  yield twice the amount of income as being an in-state student ($17,380) there? Not likely.　　No, in this consumerist age, most buyers aren’t evaluating college as an investment, but rather as a consumer product—like a car or clothes or a house. And with such purchases, price is only one of many crucial factors to consider.　　As with automobiles, consumers in today’s college marketplace have vast choices, and people search for the one that gives them the most comfort and satisfaction in line with their budgets. This accounts for the willingness of people to pay more for different types of experiences (such as attending a private liberal-arts college or going to an out-of-state public school that has a great marine-biology program). And just as two auto purchasers might spend an equal amount of money on very different cars, college students (or, more accurately, their parents) often show a willingness to pay essentially the same price for vastly different products. So which is it? Is college an investment product like a stock or a consumer product like a car? In keeping with the automotive world’s hottest consumer trend, maybe it’s best to characterize it as a hybrid (混合动力汽车); an expensive consumer product that, over time, will pay rich dividends.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　57. What’s the opinion of economists about going to college?　　A．Huge amounts of money is being wasted on campus socializing.　　B．It doesn’t pay to run into debt to receive a college education.　　C．College education is rewarding in spite of the startling costs.　　D．Going to college doesn’t necessarily bring the expected returns.　　58. The two Harvard economists note in their study that, for much of the 20th century, ________.　　A．enrollment kept decreasing in virtually all American colleges and universities　　B．the labor market preferred high-school to college graduates　　C．competition for university admissions was far more fierce than today　　D．the gap between the earnings of college and high-school graduates narrowed　　59. Students who attend an in-state college or university can ________.　　A．save more on tuition　　B．receive a better education　　C．take more liberal-arts courses　　D．avoid traveling long distances　　60. In this consumerist age, most parents ________.　　A．regard college education as a wise investment　　B．place a premium on the prestige of the College　　C．think it crucial to send their children to college　　D．consider college education a consumer product　　61. What is the chief consideration when students choose a college today?　　A．Their employment prospects after graduation.　　B．A satisfying experience within their budgets.　　C．Its facilities and learning environment.　　D．Its ranking among similar institutions.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　Some historian say that the most important contribution of Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency (总统任期) in the 1950s was the U.S. interstate highway system.

　　Part II Reading Comprehension (Skimming and Scanning) (15 minutes)
　　Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1. For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.
　　Into the Unknown
　　The world has never seen population ageing before. Can it cope?
　　Until the early 1990s nobody much thought about whole populations getting older. The UN had the foresight to convene a “world assembly on ageing” back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled “Averting the Old Age Crisis”, it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.
　　For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, sounded the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Dawn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.
　　Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue regular reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits. The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including this newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.
　　Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another question. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.
　　The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal (财政) meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time. It may even keep them alive longer. John Rother, the AARP’s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.
　　Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may be because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour force, increasing employers’ choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low, and the baby-boomers are going grey.
　　In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.
　　On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution. Many developing countries have lots of young people in need of jobs; many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in western Europe’s most youthful countries, and three times in the older ones.  would need a large multiple of the few immigrants it has at present. Public opinion polls show that people in most rich countries already think that immigration is too high. Further big increases would be politically unfeasible.
　　To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, “old” countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.
　　And if fertility in ageing countries does not pick up? It will not be the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will slowly become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50—and older people turn out to vote in much greater number than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.
　　Nor is there any sign of the intergenerational warfare predicted in the 1990s. After all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten Hank of Mannheim University found that 85% of them lived within  of each other and the majority of them were in touch at least once a week.
　　Even so, the shift in the centre of gravity to older age groups is bound to have a profound effect on societies, not just economically and politically but in all sorts of other ways too. Richard Jackson and Neil Howe of America’s CSIS, in a thoughtful book called The Graying of the Great Powers, argue that, among other things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.
　　For example, the shortage of young adults is likely to make countries more reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050,  will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world’s defence effort. Because America’s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically (地缘政治上).
　　Ask me in 2020
　　There is little that can be done to stop population ageing, so the world will have to live with it. But some of the consequences can be alleviated. Many experts now believe that given the right policies, the effects, though grave, need not be catastrophic. Most countries have recognised the need to do something and are beginning to act.
　　But even then there is no guarantee that their efforts will work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. Ronald Lee, director of the Centre on the Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: “We don’t really know what population ageing will be like, because nobody has done it yet. “

　　Section A
　　Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
　　Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　Most young boys are trained to believe that men should be strong, tough, cool, and detached. Thus, they learn early to hide vulnerable emotions such as love, joy, and sadness because they believe that such feelings are feminine and imply weakness. Over time, some men become strangers to their own emotional lives. It seems that men with traditional views of masculinity are more likely to suppress outward emotions and to fear emotions, supposedly because such feelings may lead to a loss of composure (镇定). Keep in mind, however, that this view is challenged by some researchers. As with many gender gaps, differences in emotionality tend to be small, inconsistent, and dependent on the situation. For instance, Robertson and colleagues found that males who were more traditionally masculine were more emotionally expressive in a structured exercise than when they were simply asked to talk about their emotions.
　　Males’ difficulty with “tender” emotions has serious consequences. First, suppressed emotions can contribute to stress-related disorders. And worse, men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals. Second, men’s emotional inexpressiveness can cause problems in their relationships with partners and children. For example, men who endorse traditional masculine norms report lower relationship satisfaction, as do their female partners. Further, children whose fathers are warm, loving, and accepting toward them have higher self-esteem and lower rates of aggression and behavior problems. On a positive note, fathers are increasingly involving themselves with their children. And 30 percent of fathers report that they take equal or greater responsibility for their children than their working wives do.
　　One emotion males are allowed to express is anger. Sometimes this anger translates into physical aggression or violence. Men commit nearly 90 percent of violent crimes in the United States and almost all sexual assaults.

　　Section B
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D] You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　In the early 20th century, few things were more appealing than the promise of scientific knowledge. In a world struggling with rapid industrialization, science and technology seemed to offer solutions to almost every problem. Newly created state colleges and universities devoted themselves almost entirely to scientific, technological, and engineering fields. Many Americans came to believe that scientific certainty could not only solve scientific problems, but also reform politics, government, and business. Two world wars and a Great Depression rocked the confidence of many people that scientific expertise alone could create a prosperous and ordered world. After World War Ⅱ, the academic world turned with new enthusiasm to humanistic studies, which seemed to many scholars the best way to ensure the survival of democracy. American scholars fanned out across much of the world—with support from the Ford Foundation, the Fulbright program, etc.—to promote the teaching of literature and the arts in an effort to make the case for democratic freedoms.
　　In the  of our own time, the great educational challenge has become an effort to strengthen the teaching of what is now known as the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math). There is considerable and justified concern that the  is falling behind much of the rest of the developed world in these essential disciplines. India, China, Japan, and other regions seem to be seizing technological leadership.
　　At the same time, perhaps inevitably, the humanities—while still popular in elite colleges and universities—have experienced a significant decline. Humanistic disciplines are seriously underfunded, not just by the government and the foundations but by academic institutions themselves. Humanists are usually among the lowest-paid faculty members at most institutions and are often lightly regarded because they do not generate grant income and because they provide no obvious credentials (资质) for most nonacademic careers.
　　Undoubtedly American education should train more scientists and engineers. Much of the concern among politicians about the state of American universities today is focused on the absence of “real world” education—which means preparation for professional and scientific careers. But the idea that institutions or their students must decide between humanities and science is false. Our society could not survive without scientific and technological knowledge. But we would be equally impoverished (贫困的) without humanistic knowledge as well. Science and technology teach us what we can do. Humanistic thinking helps us understand what we should do.
　　It is almost impossible to imagine our society without thinking of the extraordinary achievements of scientists and engineers in building our complicated world. But try to imagine our world as well without the remarkable works that have defined our culture and values. We have always needed, and we still need, both.

　　Passage Two
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　Will there ever be another Einstein? This is the undercurrent of conversation at Einstein memorial meetings throughout the year. A new Einstein will emerge, scientists say. But it may take a long time. After all, more than 200 years separated Einstein from his nearest rival, Isaac Newton.
　　Many physicists say the next Einstein hasn’t been born yet, or is a baby now. That’s because the quest for a unified theory that would account for all the forces of nature has pushed current mathematics to its limits. New math must be created before the problem can be solved.
　　But researchers say there are many other factors working against another Einstein emerging anytime soon.
　　For one thing, physics is a much different field today. In Einstein’s day, there were only a few thousand physicists worldwide, and the theoreticians who could intellectually rival Einstein probably would fit into a streetcar with seats to spare.
　　Education is different, too. One crucial aspect of Einstein’s training that is overlooked is the years of philosophy he read as a teenager—Kant, Schopenhauer and Spinoza, among others. It taught him how to think independently and abstractly about space and time, and it wasn’t long before he became a philosopher himself.
　　“The independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan (工匠) or specialist and a real seeker after truth,” Einstein wrote in 1944.
　　And he was an accomplished musician. The interplay between music and math is well known. Einstein would furiously play his violin as a way to think through a knotty physics problem.
　　Today, universities have produced millions of physicists. There aren’t many jobs in science for them, so they go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to apply their analytical skills to more practical—and rewarding—efforts.
　　“Maybe there is an Einstein out there today,” said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, “but it would be a lot harder for him to be heard.”
　　Especially considering what Einstein was proposing.
　　“The actual fabric of space and time curving? My God, what an idea!” Greene said at a recent gathering at the Aspen Institute. “It takes a certain type of person who will bang his head against the wall because you believe you’ll find the solution.”
　　Perhaps the best examples are the five scientific papers Einstein wrote in his “miracle year” of 1905. These “thought experiments” were pages of calculations signed and submitted to the prestigious journal Annalen der Physik by a virtual unknown. There were no footnotes or citations.
　　What might happen to such a submission today?
　　“We all get papers like those in the mail,” Greene said. “We put them in the junk file.”
　　注意： 此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
　　57. What do scientists seem to agree upon, judging from the first two paragraphs?
　　[A] Einstein pushed mathematics almost to its limits.
　　[B] It will take another Einstein to build a unified theory.
　　[C] No physicist is likely to surpass Einstein in the next 200 years.
　　[D] It will be some time before a new Einstein emerges.
　　58. What was critical to Einstein’s success?
　　[A] His talent as an accomplished musician.
　　[B] His independent and abstract thinking.
　　[C] His untiring effort to fulfill his potential.
　　[D] His solid foundation in math theory.
　　59. What does the author tell us about physicists today?
　　[A] They tend to neglect training in analytical skills.
　　[B] They are very good at solving practical problems.
　　[C] They attach great importance to publishing academic papers.
　　[D] They often go into fields yielding greater financial benefits.
　　60. What does Brian Greene imply by saying “... it would be a lot harder for him to be heard” (Lines 1-2, Para. 9)?
　　[A] People have to compete in order to get their papers published.
　　[B] It is hard for a scientist to have his papers published today.
　　[C] Papers like Einstein’s would unlikely get published today.
　　[D] Nobody will read papers on apparently ridiculous theories.
　　61. When he submitted his papers in 1905, Einstein _______.
　　[A] forgot to make footnotes and citations
　　[B] was little known in academic circles
　　[C] was known as a young genius in math calculations
　　[D] knew nothing about the format of academic papers　　Part V Cloze (15 minutes)

The ranking standards also vary. These lists have great influence on students. They are even becoming the only scale to evaluate the colleges and universities.People hold different views toward this phenomenon. Some believe that these lists help the students a lot, especially for those who will choose their university. While some other protest vigorously. In their points, the list is really ridiculous and harmful. In my view, the university ranking may have its own reference values, but its disadvantages overweigh its values.For those university-students-to-be, they are supposed to choose the school according to his or her own situation, but not the so-called Ranking List. What’s more, how about the university students? How do they feel about themselves when they see the ranking? The list may become some intangible shackles for them if their own school ranks poorly.In a nutshell, there is no easy method to rank these universities, but the Ranking, only helps students ignore the essentials, namely, their ninety-nine percent perspiration.此次六级作文的自由度很大，看似给出了提纲，实际上具体的观点全靠个人发挥。第一段需要点明大学排名这个现象，第二段需要铺陈不同人的观点，第三段要陈述自己的观点。大学排名这个题目，实际上涉及到了对了大学的理解，对于大学排名标准的理解，以及对于大学排名的目的的理解。而这件事更加离不开中国具体的国情，新中国50年代人至今受教育的情况，90后择校的情况，目前大学的情况，考生发挥的空间可以纵横数十年的教育史，并且可以深入探讨教育的本质。当然，对于大多数考生来说，凑满150个字万岁！那么，模板又可以派上用场了。模板一1.Different people have different views on——2.

D. It will be some time before a new Einstein emerges.解析：这道题针对开头两节。A和C答案比较容易排除，A说爱因斯坦把数学推到了一个极限，C说在将来的两百年都不会有物理学家超过爱因斯坦，这两个都明显不合文章大意。B答案说需要一个爱因斯坦才能建立一种大一统理论，属于过度推理，并且细节性太强了。D答案是正确答案，很多同学不敢选D的原因是，因为有些科学家们认为爱因斯坦或许还没有诞生或许还是个小婴儿，他们认为这样一来就有可能爱因斯坦已经存在了。但是这句话里面的爱因斯坦是代表伟大的科学家的意思，那么这个题目选择D就是正确的，大家都同意的是像爱因斯坦那样伟大的科学家还需要一定的时间才会出现。58. B. His independent and abstract thinking解析：B他独立与抽象思维能力。这一段是文章中间部分的内容概括。根据上下文意思推断，爱因斯坦成功的原因，不能说是他在音乐方面的天分，也不能说他的努力或者他在数学方面的深厚基础，因此答案选择B。59. D. They often go into fields yielding greater financial benefits.解析：正确答案选择D。这段文章是在问今天的物理学家们的情况， A说他们缺乏分析能力，B说他们擅长处理实际问题，C说他们重视发表文章，都是从根据文章细节中捏造出来的错误选项。D是对于文章内容的一个总结概括，数量众多的物理学家进入了更有经济利益的领域。60. D. Nobody will read papers on apparently ridiculous theories.解析：正确答案选择D。结合Greene讲的话，他说What an idea!还说是需要把头往墙上撞的人才会相信能找到个解决方案呢！说明内容实在是比较荒诞。61. B. was little known in academic circles解析：正确答案选择B，说的是爱因斯坦在学术圈里面默默无闻，跟原文里面的“by a virtual unknown”相对应。有迷惑性的选择项是D,因为文中提到了爱因斯坦的文章没有配上脚注和注释footnote and citations.但是D选择项是说，爱因斯坦不懂得论文的格式，这个属于过度推理了。Cloze62 B set out set out plans表示制定计划63 D abandoning abandon 放弃，once unshakeable orthodoxy表示曾经不可动摇的做法，也就是现在要放弃了。 with struggle with表示同…斗争，介词搭配，这里表示设法应对广告收入和报纸销售量下降的局面。65 B intends intend to表示打算…,从后面的at the beginning of 2011，可知还没有这么做，只是计划或者打算这么做。 exceeded 超过，是说当用户每月阅读文章超过一定量时就要收费。 on 和side搭配，on the side of …表示拥护…；站在…一边。68 D charge 本词在文章中多次出现，charge sb表示向某人收费。 such as 表示举例，从后面举London's Evening Standard作为例子，可知应该选such as.70 B free 前面提到abandon readership revenue，即放弃读者收益，由此可知应该是make print editions free. acknowledged 表示承认，这里表示Arthur Sulzberger承认这么做是一种赌博。 bet 打赌，赌注，从前面的gamble可知应该选bet。 circulation 发行量，从后面的数量可知应该选circulation。 behind NYT排名第三，即排在the Wall Street Journal and USA Today后面。75 B While while在这里表示对比，从上下文可知NYT与美国其他报纸不同。76 D claim 声称，宣称，这里是说NYT声称自己是全国范围的报纸。 maintains 维持，运营，即NYT还在世界其他地方运营着26个办公室。 like 从下文可知NYT和印刷行业的其他公司一样，也受到金融危机的影响，所以选like，表示同…一样。79 D serious 严重的，考察形容词与名词的搭配，从下文的数据可知遭受严重经济损失。 suffered 遭受，suffer a loss遭受损失，常见搭配。81 D loan 贷款，前文提到公司损失了很多钱，所以需要从别处借钱来补充资金。Translation82. There is no denying that you ___________(越仔细越好) in dealing with this matter.解析：can never be too careful / can not be too careful【考点解释】本题考查“越仔细越好”“再…也不为过”的固定搭配，即can never be too/can not be too + adj.【原句精释】无可否认，处理这件事，越仔细越好。83.

    As Erin White watched the election results head towards victory for Barack Obama, she felt a burden lifting from her shoulders. "In that one second, it was a validation for my whole race," she recalls.
    "I've always been an achiever," says White, who is studying for an MBA at   in . "But there had always been these things in the back of my mind questioning whether I really can be who I want. It was like a shadow, following me around saying you can only go so far. Now it's like a barrier has been let down."
    White's experience is what many psychologists had expected - that Obama would prove to be a powerful role model for African Americans. Some hoped his rise to prominence would have a big impact on white Americans, too, challenging those who still harbour racist sentiments. "The traits that characterise him are very contradictory to the racial stereotypes that black people are aggressive and uneducated," says Ashby Plant of . "He's very intelligent and eloquent."Sting in the tail
    Ashby Plant is one of a number of psychologists who seized on Obama's candidacy to test hypotheses about the power of role models. Their work is already starting to reveal how the "Obama effect" is changing people's views and behaviour. Perhaps surprisingly, it is not all good news: there is a sting in the tail of the Obama effect.
    But first the good news. Barack Obama really is a positive role model for African Americans, and he was making an impact even before he got to the White House. Indeed, the Obama effect can be surprisingly immediate and powerful, as Ray Friedman of  and his colleagues discovered.
    They tested four separate groups at four key stages of Obama's presidential campaign. Each group consisted of around 120 adults of similar age and education, and the test assessed their language skills. At two of these stages, when Obama's success was less than certain, the tests showed a clear difference between the scores of the white and black participants—an average of 12.1 out of 20, compared to 8.8, for example. When the Obama fever was at its height, however, the black participants performed much better. Those who had watched Obama's acceptance speech as the Democrats' presidential candidate performed just as well, on average, as the white subjects.After his election victory, this was true of all the black participants.
Dramatic shift
    What can explain this dramatic shift? At the start of the test, the participants had to declare their race and were told their results would be used to assess their strengths and weaknesses. This should have primed the subjects with "stereotype threat" – an anxiety that their results will confirm negative stereotypes, which has been shown to damage the performance of African Americans.
    Obama's successes seemed to act as a shield against this. "We suspect they felt inspired and energised by his victory, so the stereotype threat wouldn't prove a distraction," says Friedman.Lingering racism
    If the Obama effect is positive for African Americans, how is it affecting their white compatriots (同胞)? Is the experience of having a charismatic (有魅力的) black president modifying lingering racist attitudes? There is no easy way to measure racism directly; instead psychologists assess what is known as "implicit bias", using a computer-based test that measures how quickly people associate positive and negative words—such as "love" or "evil"—with photos of black or white faces. A similar test can also measure how quickly subjects associate stereotypical traits—such as athletic skills or mental ability—with a particular group.
    In a study that will appear in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Plant's team tested 229 students during the height of the Obama fever. They found that implicit bias has fallen by as much as 90% compared with the level found in a similar study in 2006. "That's an unusually large drop," Plant says.
    While the team can't be sure their results are due solely to Obama, they also showed that those with the lowest bias were likely to subconsciously associate black skin colour with political words such as "government" or "president". This suggests that Obama was strongly on their mind, says Plant.
Drop in bias
    Brian Nosek of the  of  in , who runs a website that measures implicit bias using similar test, has also observed a small drop in bias in the 700,000 visitors to the site since January 2007, which might be explained by Obama's rise to popularity. However, his preliminary results suggest that change will be much slower coming than Plant's results suggest.
Talking honestly
    "People now have the opportunity of expressing support for Obama every day," says Daniel Effron at   in . "Our research arouses the concern that people may now be more likely to raise negative views of African Americans." On the other hand, he says, it may just encourage people to talk more honestly about their feelings regarding race issues, which may not be such a bad thing.
    Another part of the study suggests far more is at stake than the mere expression of views. The Obama effect may have a negative side. Just one week after Obama was elected president, participants were less ready to support policies designed to address racial inequality than they had been two weeks before the election. Huge obstacles
    It could, of course, also be that Obama's success helps people to forget that a disproportionate number of black Americans still live in poverty and face huge obstacles when trying to overcome these circumstances. "Barack Obama's family is such a salient (出色的) image, we generalise it and fail to see the larger picture—that there's injustice in every aspect of American life," says Cheryl Kaiser of the University of Washington in Seattle. Those trying to address issues of racial inequality need to constantly remind people of the inequalities that still exist to counteract the Obama's effect, she says.
    Though Plant's findings were more positive, she too warns against thinking that racism and racial inequalities are no longer a problem. "The last thing I want is for people to think everything's solved."
    These findings do not only apply to Obama, or even just to race. They should hold for any role model in any country. "There's no reason we wouldn't have seen the same effect on our views of women if Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin had been elected," says Effron. So the election of a female leader might have a downside for other women.
Beyond race
    We also don't yet know how long the Obama effect—both its good side and its bad—will last.Political sentiment is notoriously changeable: What if things begin to go wrong for Obama, and his popularity slumps?
    And what if Americans become so familiar with having Obama as their president that they stop considering his race altogether? "Over time he might become his own entity," says Plant. This might seem like the ultimate defeat for racism, but ignoring the race of certain select individuals—a phenomenon that psychologists call subtyping—also has an insidious (隐伏的) side. "We think it happens to help people preserve their beliefs, so they can still hold on to the previous stereotypes." That could turn out to be the cruellest of all the twists to the Obama effect.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
    Question: My ninth-grade art teacher doesn't give any grade above 94% because, she says, "There's always room for improvement." In previous years, I earned a 99% and a 100%. The 94 I received this term does not reflect the hard work that I put into this course. Because of her "improvement" theory, I got a lower grade than I deserve. Is her grading philosophy ethical (符合职业道德规范的)?
    Answer: Your teacher's grading system may be unwise, but it is not unethical. A teacher deserves wide latitude in selecting the method of grading that best promotes learning in her classroom; that is, after all, the prime function of grades. It is she who has the training and experience to make this decision. Assuming that your teacher is neither biased nor corrupt and that her system conforms to school rules, you can't fault her ethics.
    You can criticize her methodology. A 100 need not imply that there is no possibility of improvement, only that a student successfully completed the course work. A ninth grader could get a well-earned  English class but still have a way to go before she writes as well as Jane Austen. What's more, grades are not only an educational device but are also part of a screening system to help assign kids to their next class or program. By capping her grades at 94 while most other teachers grade on a scale that tops out at 100, your teacher could jeopardize a student's chance of getting a scholarship or getting into a top college.
    What it is wrong to condemn her for is overlooking your hard work. You diligence is worthy of encouragement, but effort does not equal accomplishment. If scholars suddenly discovered that Rembrandt had dashed off "The Night Watch" in an afternoon, it would still be "The Night Watch."
    I could spend months sweating over my own "paintings", but I'd produce something you wouldn't want to hang in your living room. Or your garage.
    One feature of a good grading system is that those measured by it generally regard it as fair and reasonable—not the case here. Simmering (难以平息的) resentment is seldom an aid to education.And so your next step should be to discuss your concerns with your teacher or the principal.

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 51 to 56 are based on the following passage.
    Only two countries in the advanced world provide no guarantee for paid leave from work to care for a newborn child. Last spring one of the two, , gave up the dubious distinction by establishing paid family leave starting in 2011. I wasn't surprised when this didn't make the news here in the —we're now the only wealthy country without such a policy.
    The  does have one explicit family policy, the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993. It entitles workers to as much as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for care of a newborn or dealing with a family medical problem. Despite the modesty of the benefit, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups fought it bitterly, describing it as "government-run personnel management" and a "dangerous precedent". In fact, every step of the way, as (usually) Democratic leaders have tried to introduce work-family balance measures into the law, business groups have been strongly opposed.
    As Yale law professor Anne Alstott argues, justifying parental support depends on defining the family as a social good that, in some sense, society must pay for. In her book No Exit: What Parents Owe Their Children and What Society Owes Parents, she argues that parents are burdened in many ways in their lives: there is "no exit" when it comes to children. "Society expects—and needs—parents to provide their children with continuity of care, meaning the intensive, intimate care that human beings need to develop their intellectual, emotional and moral capabilities. And society expects—and needs—parents to persist in their roles for 18 years, or longer if needed."
    While most parents do this out of love, there are public penalties for not providing care. What parents do, in other words, is of deep concern to the state, for the obvious reason that caring for children is not only morally urgent but essential for the future of society. The state recognizes this in the large body of family laws that govern children' welfare, yet parents receive little help in meeting the life-changing obligations society imposes. To classify parenting as a personal choice for which there is no collective responsibility is not merely to ignore the social benefits of good parenting; really, it is to steal those benefits because they accrue (不断积累) to the whole of society as today's children become tomorrow's productive citizenry (公民). In fact, by some estimates, the value of parental investments in children, investments of time and money (including lost wages), is equal to 20-30% of gross domestic product. If these investments generate huge social benefits—as they clearly do—the benefits of providing more social support for the family should be that much clearer.

Questions 57 to 62 are based on the following passage.
    A new study from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at  shows that today's youth vote in larger numbers than previous generations, and a 2008 study from the Center for American Progress adds that increasing numbers of young voters and activists support traditionally liberal causes. But there's no easy way to see what those figures mean in real life. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama assembled a racially and ideologically diverse coalition with his message of hope and change; as the reality of life under a new administration settles in, some of those supporters might become disillusioned. As the nation moves further into the Obama presidency, will politically engaged young people continue to support the president and his agenda, or will they gradually drift away?
    The writers of Generation O (short for Obama), a new Newsweek blog that seeks to chronicle the lives of a group of young Obama supporters, want to answer that question. For the next three months, Michelle Kremer and 11 other Obama supporters, ages 19 to 34, will blog about life across mainstream America, with one twist: by tying all of their ideas and experiences to the new president and his administration, the bloggers will try to start a conversation about what it means to be young and politically active in America today. Malena Amusa, a 24-year-old writer and dancer from  sees the project as a way to preserve history as it happens. Amusa, who is traveling to  this spring to finish a book, then to  to teach English, has ongoing conversations with her friends about how the Obama presidency has changed their daily lives and hopes to put some of those ideas, along with her global perspective, into her posts. She's excited because, as she puts it, "I don't have to wait [until] 15 years from  now" to make sense of the world.
    Henry Flores, a political-science professor at St. Mary's University, credits this younger generation's political strength to their embrace of technology. "[The Internet] exposes them to more thinking," he says, "and groups that are like-minded in different parts of the country start to come together." That's exactly what the Generation O bloggers are hoping to do. The result could be a group of young people that, like their boomer (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人) parents, grows up with a strong sense of purpose and sheds the image of apathy (冷漠) they've inherited from Generation X (60 年代后期和70 年代出生的美国人). It's no small challenge for a blog run by a group of ordinary—if ambitious—young people, but the members of Generation O are up to the task.

A good command of at least one foreign language has increasingly been an essential skill for us. People, especially the youths, pay much more attention to foreign language acquisitionthan Chinese study.Various factors can account forthis situation. First of all, a good command of a foreign language may help young people to get a good job while Chinese skills may be of no significancein one’s job hunting and even their career. Consequently, some students may not treasure Chinese language any longer. Apart from that, nowadays fewer and fewer universities stimulate Chinese language study in campus, which has caused it to be marginalized. Under this circumstance, Chinese language becomes less and less popular in universities. It is clear that professors in the field of Chinese study are not so respected than they were before.In view of this situation, effective measures should be taken to change it. First, the whole society should emphasizethe importance of Chinese language in order to make it clear that it is one indispensablepart of Chinese culture and Chinese race. Second, schools should promote Chinese language study and research. In addition, we individuals should contribute our own efforts to the study and protectionof Chinese language.To conclude, we should pay great attention to Chinese language, since the importance of it is never too great to be exaggerated.快速阅读1.

So far, Google has scanned more than 10 million titles from libraries in  and Europe - including half a million volumes held by the Bodleian in . The exact method it uses is unclear; the company does not allow outsiders to observe the process.Why is Google undertaking such a venture? Why is it even interested in all those out-of-printlibrary books, most of which have been gathering dust on forgotten shelves for decades? Thecompany claims its motives are essentially public-spirited. Its overall mission, after all, is to "organise the world's information", so it would be odd if that information did not include books.The company likes to present itself as having lofty aspirations. "This really isn't about making money. We are doing this for the good of society." As Santiago de , head of Google Books for , puts it: "By making it possible to search the millions of books that exist today, we hope to expand the frontiers of human knowledge."Dan Clancy, the chief architect of Google Books, does seem genuine in his conviction that thisis primarily a philanthropic (慈善的) exercise. "Google's core business is search and find, soobviously what helps improve Google's search engine is good for Google," he says. "But we havenever built a spreadsheet (电子数据表) outlining the financial benefits of this, and I have neverhad to justify the amount I am spending to the company's founders."It is easy, talking to Clancy and his colleagues, to be swept along by their missionary passion. But Google's book-scanning project is proving controversial. Several opponents have recently emerged, ranging from rival tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon to small bodies representing authors and publishers across the world. In broad terms, these opponents have levelled two sets of criticisms at Google.First, they have questioned whether the primary responsibility for digitally archiving the world's books should be allowed to fall to a commercial company. In a recent essay in the New YorkReview of Books, Robert Darnton, the head of 's library, argued that because such books are a common resource – the possession of us all – only public, not-for-profit bodiesshould be given the power to control them.The second related criticism is that Google's scanning of books is actually illegal. This allegation has led to Google becoming mired in (陷入) a legal battle whose scope and complexity makes the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case in Charles Dickens' Bleak House look straightforward.At its centre, however, is one simple issue: that of copyright. The inconvenient fact about most books, to which Google has arguably paid insufficient attention, is that they are protected by copyright. Copyright laws differ from country to country, but in general protection extends for the duration of an author's life and for a substantial period afterwards, thus allowing the author's heirs to benefit. (In  and , this post-death period is 70 years.) This means, of course, that almost all of the books published in the 20th century are still under copyright – and the last century saw more books published than in all previous centuries combined. Of the roughly 40 million books in US libraries, for example, an estimated 32 million are in copyright. Of these, some 27 million are out of print.Outside the , Google has made sure only to scan books that are out of copyright and thus in the "public domain" (works such as the Bodleian's first edition of Middlemarch, which anyone canread for free on Google Books Search).But, within the , the company has scanned both in-copyright and out-of-copyright works. Inits defence, Google points out that it displays only small segments of books that are in copyright– arguing that such displays are "fair use". But critics allege that by making electronic copies of these books without first seeking the permission of copyright holders, Google has committed piracy."The key principle of copyright law has always been that works can be copied only once authors have expressly given their permission," says Piers Blofeld, of the   literary agency in . "Google has reversed this – it has simply copied all these works without bothering toask."In 2005, the Authors Guild of America, together with a group of US publishers, launched aclass action suit (集团诉讼) against Google that, after more than two years of negotiation, endedwith an announcement last October that Google and the claimants had reached an out-of-courtsettlement. The full details are complicated - the text alone runs to 385 pages– and trying tosummarise it is no easy task. "Part of the problem is that it is basically incomprehensible," saysBlofeld, one of the settlement's most vocal British critics.Broadly, the deal provides a mechanism for Google to compensate authors and publishers whose rights it has breached (including giving them a share of any future revenue it generates fromtheir works). In exchange for this, the rights holders agree not to sue Google in future.This settlement hands Google the power - but only with the agreement of individual rights holders – to exploit its database of out-of-print books. It can include them in subscription deals sold to libraries or sell them individually under a consumer licence. It is these commercial provisions that are proving the settlement's most controversial aspect.Critics point out that, by giving Google the right to commercially exploit its database, thesettlement paves the way for a subtle shift in the company's role from provider of information to seller. "Google's business model has always been to provide information for free, and sell advertising on the basis of the traffic this generates," points out James Grimmelmann, associate professor at . Now, he says, because of the settlement's provisions, Google could become a significant force in bookselling.Interest in this aspect of the settlement has focused on "orphan" works, where there is noknown copyright holder – these make up an estimated 5-10% of the books Google has scanned. Under the settlement, when no rights holders come forward and register their interest in a work, commercial control automatically reverts to Google. Google will be able to display up to 20% oforphan works for free, include them in its subscription deals to libraries and sell them to individual buyers under the consumer licence.It is by no means certain that the settlement will be enacted (执行) – it is the subject of afairness hearing in the US courts. But if it is enacted, Google will in effect be off the hook as far as copyright violations in the  are concerned. Many people are seriously concerned by this - and the company is likely to face challenges in other courts around the world.No one knows the precise use Google will make of the intellectual property it has gained byscanning the world's library books, and the truth, as Gleick, an American science writer and member of the Authors Guild, points out, is that the company probably doesn't even know itself. But what is certain is that, in some way or other, Google's entrance into digital bookselling will have a significant impact on the book world in the years to come.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。1. Google claims its plan for the world's biggest online library is _____.A)  to serve the interest of the general publicB)  to encourage reading around the worldC)  to save out-of-print books in librariesD)  to promote its core business of searching2. According to Santiago de , Google's book-scanning project will _____.A)  broaden humanity's intellectual horizonsB)  help the broad masses of readersC)  revolutionise the entire book industryD)  make full use of the power of its search engine3. Opponents of Google Books believe that digitally archiving the world's books should be controlled by _____.A)  non-profit organisations                               C) multinational companiesB)  the world's leading libraries                          D) the world's tech giants4. Google has involved itself in a legal battle as it ignored _____.A)  the copyright of authors of out-of-print booksB)  the copyright of the books it scannedC)  the interest of traditional booksellersD)  the differences of in-print and out-of-print books5. Google defends its scanning in-copyright books by saying that _____.A)  it displays only a small part of their contentB)  it is willing to compensate the copyright holdersC)  making electronic copies of books is not a violation of copyrightD)  the online display of in-copyright books is not for commercial use6. What do we learn about the class action suit against Google?A)  It ended in a victory for the Authors Guild of America.B)  It was settled after more than two years of negotiation.C)  It failed to protect the interests of American publishers.D)  It could lead to more out-of-court settlements of such disputes.7. What remained controversial after the class action suit ended?A)  The compensation for copyright holders.B)  The change in Google's business model.C)  Google's further exploitation of its database.D)  The commercial provisions of the settlement.8.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.Leadership is the most significant word in today's competitive business environment because it directs the manager of a business to focus inward on their personal capabilities and style. Experts on leadership will quickly point out that "how things get done" influences the success of the outcomes and indicates a right way and a wrong way to do things. When a noted leader on the art of management, Peter Drucker, coined the phrase "Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things," he was seeking to clarify the distinctions he associates with the terms.When Stephen Covey, founder and director of the Leadership Institute, explored leadership styles in the past decade, he focused on the habits of a great number of highly effective individuals. His Seven Habits of Highly Effective People became a popular bestseller very quickly. His ideas forced a reexamination of the early leadership paradigm (范例), which he observed centered on traits found in the character ethic and the personality ethic. The former ethic suggested success was founded on integrity, modesty, loyalty, courage, patience, and so forth. The personality ethic suggested it was one's attitude, not behavior, that inspired success, and this ethic was founded on a belief of positive mental attitude. In contrast to each of these ideas, Covey advocates that leaders need to understand universal principles of effectiveness, and he highlights how vital it is for leaders to first personally manage themselves if they are to enjoy any hope of outstanding success in their work environments. To achieve a desired vision for your business, it is vital that you have a personal vision of where you are headed and what you value. Business leadership means that managers need to "put first things first," which implies that before leading others, you need to be clear on your own values, abilities, and strengths and be seen as trustworthy.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。47.   To be good leaders, managers must pay close attention to their own _____.48.   According to Peter Drucker, leaders should be good at _____.49.   The personality ethic suggests that people are likely to succeed if they have _____.50.   According to Stephen Covey, leaders who hope to achieve outstanding success need first of all to _____.51.   Good leadership requires one to know one's own strengths and be able to win people's _____. Section BDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.What's the one word of advice a well-meaning professional would give to a recent college graduate? "} ! ! How about trade!When the Commerce Department reported last week that the trade deficit in June approached $50 billion, it set off a new round of economic doomsaying. Imports, which soared to $200.3 billion in the month, are subtracted in the calculation of gross domestic product. The larger the trade deficit, the smaller the GDP. Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth.But there's another way of looking at the trade data. Over the past two years, the figures on imports and exports seem not to signal a double-dip recession – a renewed decline in the broad level of economic activity in the  – but an economic expansion.The rising volume of trade – more goods and services shuttling in and out of the  – is good news for many sectors. Companies engaged in shipping, trucking, rail freight, delivery,                                                            and logistics (物流) have all been reporting better than expected results. The rising numbers signify growing vitality in foreign markets – when we import more stuff, it puts more cash in the hands of people around the world, and  exports are rising because more foreigners have the ability to buy the things we produce and market. The rising tide of trade is also good news for people who work in trade-sensitive businesses, especially those that produce commodities for which global demand sets the price – agricultural goods, mining, metals, oil.And while exports always seem to lag,  companies are becoming more involved in the global economy with each passing month. General Motors sells as many cars in  as in  each month. While that may not do much for imports, it does help GM's balance sheet – and hence makes the jobs of U.S.-based executives more stable.One great challenge for the  economy is slack domestic consumer demand. Americans are
paying down debt, saving more, and spending more carefully. That's to be expected, given what we've been through. But there's a bigger challenge. Can U.S.-based businesses, large and small, figure out how to get a piece of growing global demand? Unless you want to pick up and move to , or , or , the best way to do that is through trade. It may seem obvious, but it's no longer enough simply to do business with our friends and neighbors here at home.Companies and individuals who don't have a strategy to export more, or to get more involved in foreign markets, or to play a role in global trade, are shutting themselves out of the lion's share of economic opportunity in our world.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。52. How do pessimists interpret the  trade deficit in June?A)  It reflects Americans' preference for imported goods.B)  It signifies a change in American economic structure.C)  It is the result of 's growing focus on domestic market.D)  It could lead to slower growth of the national economy.53. What does the author say about the trade data of the past two years?A)  It indicates that economic activities in the  have increased.B)  It shows that  economy is slipping further into recession.C)      It signals decreasing domestic demand for goods and services.D)     It reflects the fluctuations in the international market.54. Who particularly benefit from the rising volume of trade?A)  People who have expertise in international trade.B)  Consumers who favor imported goods and services.C)      Producers of agricultural goods and raw materials.D)     Retailers dealing in foreign goods and services.55. What is one of the challenges facing the American economy?A)  Competition from overseas.                             C) Slack trade activities.B)  People's reluctance to spend.                            D) Decreasing productivity.56. What is the author's advice to  companies and individuals?A)  To import more cheap goods from developing countries.B)  To move their companies to where labor is cheaper.C)      To increase their market share overseas.D)     To be alert to fluctuations in foreign markets. Passage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.A recurring criticism of the 's university sector is its perceived weakness in translating new knowledge into new products and services.Recently, the UK National Stem Cell Network warned the  could lose its place among the world leaders in stem cell research unless adequate funding and legislation could be assured. We should take this concern seriously as universities are key in the national innovation system.However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market. The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in , ,  and  shows that, from a relatively weak startingposition, the  now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity.When viewed at the national level, the policy interventions of the past decade have helpedtransform the performance of  universities. Evidence suggests the 's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very largevariation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number ofuniversities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase theleaders.This type of uneven distribution is not peculiar to the  and is mirrored across other economies. In the , research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and licence income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialisation work creates differences between universities.The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact oftheir research efforts. These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise in order to build greater confidence in the sector.Part of the economic recovery of the  will be driven by the next generation of research commercialisation spilling out of our universities. There are three dozen universities in the UKwhich are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialisation work.If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the  for the next growth cycle.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。57. What does the author think of  universities in terms of commercialisation?A)     They fail to convert knowledge into money.B)      They do not regard it as their responsibility.C)      They still have a place among the world leaders.D)     They have lost their leading position in many ways.58. What does the author say about the national data on  universities' performance in commercialisation?A)     It masks the fatal weaknesses of government policy.B)      It does not rank  universities in a scientific way.C)      It does not reflect the differences among universities.D)     It indicates their ineffective use of government resources.59. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that "policy interventions" (Line 1, Para. 4) refers to _____.A)     government aid to non-research-oriented universitiesB)      compulsory cooperation between universities and industriesC)      fair distribution of funding for universities and research institutionsD)     concentration of resources in a limited number of universities60. What does the author suggest research-led universities do?A)     Publicise their research to win international recognition.B)      Fully utilise their research to benefit all sectors of society.C)      Generously share their facilities with those short of funds.D)     Spread their influence among top research institutions.61. How can the university sector play a key role in the 's economic growth?A)     By establishing more regional technology transfer offices.B)      By asking the government to invest in technology transfer research.C)      By promoting technology transfer and graduate school education.D)     By increasing the efficiency of technology transfer agencies.  Part V                                Cloze                                  (15 minutes)Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

Graduating them is another matter.Barry Mills, the president of , was justifiably proud of Bowdoin's efforts to recruit minority students. Since 2003 the small, elite liberal arts school in , has boosted the proportion of so-called under-represented minority students in entering freshman classes from 8% to 13%. "It is our responsibility to reach out and attract students to come to our kinds of places," he told a NEWSWEEK reporter. But Bowdoin has not done quite as well when it comes to actually graduating minorities. While 9 out of 10 white students routinely get their diplomas within six years, only 7 out of 10 black students made it to graduation day in several recent classes."If you look at who enters college, it now looks like ," says Hilary Pennington, director of postsecondary programs for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has closely studied enrollment patterns in higher education. "But if you look at who walks across the stage for a diploma, it's still largely the white, upper-income population."The  once had the highest graduation rate of any nation. Now it stands 10th. For the first time in American history, there is the risk that the rising generation will be less well educated than the previous one. The graduation rate among 25- to 34-year-olds is no better than the rate for the 55- to 64-year-olds who were going to college more than 30 years ago. Studies show that more and more poor and non-white students want to graduate from college – but their graduation rates fall far short of their dreams. The graduation rates for blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans lag far behind the graduation rates for whites and Asians. As the minority population grows in the , low college graduation rates become a threat to national prosperity.The problem is pronounced at public universities. In 2007 the  – one of the top five or so prestigious public universities – graduated 81% of its white students within six years, but only 56% of its blacks. At less-selective state schools, the numbers get worse. During the same time frame, the  graduated 67% of its white students, but only 39% of its blacks. Community colleges have low graduation rates generally – but rock-bottom rates for minorities. A recent review of  community colleges found that while a third of the Asian students picked up their degrees, only 15% of African-Americans did so as well.Private colleges and universities generally do better, partly because they offer smaller classes and more personal attention. But when it comes to a significant graduation gap, Bowdoin has company. Nearby  logged an 18-point difference between white and black graduates in 2007 and 25 points in 2006.   in , another top school, had a 19-point gap in 2007 and a 22-point gap in 2006. The most selective private schools – Harvard, Yale, and  – show almost no gap between black and white graduation rates. But that may have more to do with their ability to select the best students. According to data gathered by    professor Lain Gainer, the most selective schools are more likely to choose blacks who have at least one immigrant parent from Africa or the  than black students who are descendants of American slaves."Higher education has been able to duck this issue for years, particularly the more selective schools, by saying the responsibility is on the individual student," says Pennington of the Gates Foundation. "If they fail, it's their fault." Some critics blame affirmative action – students admitted with lower test scores and grades from shaky high schools often struggle at elite schools. But a bigger problem may be that poor high schools often send their students to colleges for which they are "under matched": they could get into more elite, richer schools, but instead go to community colleges and low-rated state schools that lack the resources to help them. Some schools out for profit cynically increase tuitions and count on student loans and federal aid to foot the bill – knowing full well that the students won't make it. "The school keeps the money, but the kid leaves with loads of debt and no degree and no ability to get a better job. Colleges are not holding up their end," says Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust.A college education is getting ever more expensive. Since 1982 tuitions have been rising at roughly twice the rate of inflation. In 2008 the net cost of attending a four-year public university – after financial aid – equaled 28% of median (中间的)family income, while a four-year private university cost 76% of median family income. More and more scholarships are based on merit, not need. Poorer students are not always the best-informed consumers. Often they wind up deeply in debt or simply unable to pay after a year or two and must drop out.There once was a time when universities took pride in their dropout rates. Professors would begin the year by saying, "Look to the right and look to the left. One of you is not going to be here by the end of the year." But such a Darwinian spirit is beginning to give way as at least a few colleges face up to the graduation gap. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the gap has been roughly halved over the last three years. The university has poured resources into peer counseling to help students from inner-city schools adjust to the rigor (严格要求)and faster pace of a university classroom –and also to help minority students overcome the stereotype that they are less qualified. Wisconsin has a "laser like focus" on building up student skills in the first three months, according to vice provost (教务长)Damon Williams.State and federal governments could sharpen that focus everywhere by broadly publishing minority graduation rates. For years private colleges such as  and MIT have had success bringing minorities onto campus in the summer before freshman year to give them some prepare Tory courses. The newer trend is to start recruiting poor and non-white students as early as the seventh grade, using innovative tools to identify kids with sophisticated verbal skills. Such programs can be expensive, of course, but cheap compared with the millions already invested in scholarships and grants for kids who have little chance to graduate without special support.With effort and money, the graduation gap can be closed. Washington and Lee is a small, selective school in  Its student body is less than 5% black and less than 2% Latino. While the school usually graduated about 90% of its whites, the graduation rate of its blacks and Latinos had dipped to 63% by 2007. "We went through a dramatic shift," says Dawn Watkins, the vice president for student affairs. The school aggressively pushed mentoring (辅导) of minorities by other students and "partnering" with parents at a special pre-enrollment session. The school had its first-ever black homecoming. Last spring the school graduated the same proportion of minorities as it did whites. If the  wants to keep up in the global economic race, it will have to pay systematic attention to graduating minorities, not just enrolling them.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。1.   What is the author's main concern about American higher education?A)  The small proportion of minority students.B)  The low graduation rates of minority students.C)  The growing conflicts among ethnic groups.D)  The poor academic performance of students.2.   What was the pride of President Barry Mills of ?A) The prestige of its liberal arts programs.B)  Its ranking among universities in .C)  The high graduation rates of its students.D) Its increased enrollment of minority students.3.   What is the risk facing ?A) Its schools will be overwhelmed by the growing number of illegal immigrants.B)  The rising generation will be less well educated than the previous one.C)  More poor and non-white students will be denied access to college.D) It is going to lose its competitive edge in higher education.4.   How many African-American students earned their degrees in  community colleges according to a recent review?A)  Fifty-six percent.    B)  Thirty-nine percent.    C) Fifteen percent     D) Sixty-seven percent.5.   Harvard, Yale, and  show almost no gap between black and white graduation rates mainly because   .A) Their students work harder  B)  They recruit the best students    C) Their classes are generally smaller               D) They give students more attention6.  How does Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust view minority students' failure to get a degree?A) Universities are to blame.B)  Students don't work hard.C)  The government fails to provide the necessary support.D) Affirmative action should be held responsible.7.   Why do some students drop out after a year or two according to the author?A) They have lost confidence in themselves.B)  They cannot afford the high tuition.C)  They cannot adapt to the rigor of the school.D) They fail to develop interest in their studies.8. To tackle the problem of graduation gap, the University of Wisconsin-Madison helps minority students get over the stereotype that _______.9.  For years, private colleges such as  and MIT have provided minority students with _______ during the summer before freshman year.10.    and  is cited as an example to show that the gap of graduation rates between whites and minorities can _______.Partial Listening Comprehension (35minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.How good are you at saying "no"? For many, it's surprisingly difficult. This is especially true of editors, who by nature tend to be eager and engaged participants in everything they do. Consider these scenarios:It's late in the day. That front-page package you've been working on is nearly complete; one last edit and it's finished. Enter the executive editor, who makes a suggestion requiring a more-than-modest rearrangement of the design and the addition of an information box. You want to scream: "No! It's done!" What do you do?The first rule of saying no to the boss is doing say no. She probably has something in mind when she makes suggestions, and it's up to you to find out what. The second rule is doing raise the stakes by challenging her authority. That issue is already decided. The third rule is to be ready to cite options and consequences. The boss's suggestions might be appropriate, but there are always consequences. She might not know about the pages backing up that need attention, or about the designer who had to go home sick. Tell her she can have what she wants, but explain the consequences. Understand what she's trying to accomplish and propose a Plan B that will make it happen without destroying what you've done so far.Here's another case. Your least-favorite reporter suggests a dumb story idea. This one should be easy, but it's not. If you say no, even politely, you risk inhibiting further ideas, not just from that reporter, but from others who heard that you turned down the idea. This scenario is common in newsrooms that lack a systematic way to filter story suggestions.Two steps are necessary. First, you need a system for how stories are proposed and reviewed. Reporters can tolerate rejection of their ideas if they believe they were given a fair hearing. Your gut reaction (本能反应) and dismissive rejection, even of a worthless idea, might not qualify as systematic or fair.Second, the people you work with need to negotiate a "What if ...?" agreement covering "What if my idea is turned down?" How are people expected to react? Is there an appeal process? Can they refine the idea and resubmit it? By anticipating "What if...?" situations before they happen, you can reach understanding that will help ease you out of confrontations.47.   Instead of directly saying no to your boss, you should find out __________.48.   The author's second warning is that we should avoid running a greater risk by __________.49.   one way of responding to your boss's suggestion is to explain the __________ to her and offer an alternative solution.50.   To ensure fairness to reporters, it is important to set up a system for stories to __________.51.   People who learn to anticipate "What if...?" situations will be able to reach understanding and avoid __________.Section BDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.At the heart of the debate over illegal immigration lies one key question: are immigrants good or bad for the economy? The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad. Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants' impact on the economy and the reality?There are a number of familiar theories. Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers. Others highlight the strain that undocumented immigrants place on public services, like schools, hospitals, and jails. Still others emphasize the role of race, arguing that foreigners add to the nation's fears and insecurities. There's some truth to all these explanations, but they aren't quite sufficient.To get a better understanding of what's going on; consider the way immigration's impact is felt. Though its overall effect may be positive, its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly. David Card, an economist at UC Berkeley, notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants' low-cost labor are businesses and employers – meatpacking plants in , for instance, or agricultural businesses in . Granted, these producers' savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store, but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration, these, too, are concentrated. Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor. According to a study by George Boras, a Harvard economist, immigration reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9% between 1980-2000.Among high-skilled, better-educated employees, however, opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services. What worried them most, in other words, was the fiscal (财政的)burden of immigration. That conclusion was reinforced by another finding: that their opposition appeared to soften when that fiscal burden decreased, as occurred with welfare reform in the 1990s, which curbed immigrants' access to certain benefits.The irony is that for all the overexcited debate, the net effect of immigration is minimal. Even for those most acutely affected – say, low-skilled workers, or  residents – the impact isn't all that dramatic. "The unpleasant voices have tended to dominate our perceptions," says Daniel Michener, a political science professor at the . "But when all those factors are put together and the economists calculate the numbers, it ends up being a net positive, but a small one." Too bad most people don't realize it.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。52. What can we learn from the first paragraph?A)  Whether immigrants are good or bad for the economy has been puzzling economists.B)  The American economy used to thrive on immigration but now it's a different story.C)  The consensus among economists is that immigration should not be encouraged.D)  The general public thinks differently from most economists on the impact of immigration.53. In what way does the author think ordinary Americans benefit from immigration?A)  They can access all kinds of public services.B)  They can get consumer goods at lower prices.C)  They can mix with people of different cultures.D)  They can avoid doing much of the manual labor.54. Why do native low-skilled workers suffer most from illegal immigration?A)  They have greater difficulty getting welfare support.B)  They are more likely to encounter interracial conflicts.C)  They have a harder time getting a job with decent pay.D)  They are no match for illegal immigrants in labor skills.55. What is the chief concern of native high-skilled, better-educated employees about the inflow of immigrants?A)  It may change the existing social structure.B)  It may pose a threat to their economic status.C)  It may lead to social instability in the country.D)  It may place a great strain on the state budget.56. What is the irony about the debate over immigration?A) Even economists can't reach a consensus about its impact.B)  Those who are opposed to it turn out to benefit most from it.C)  People are making too big a fuss about something of small impact.D) There is no essential difference between seemingly opposite opinions.Passage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.Picture a typical MBA lecture theatre twenty years ago. In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women – the  of 's , for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmers recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach – arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context.Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Manna, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management – at least in  and . Perhaps most significant, according to Manna, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。57.

　　标准版   My opinion on certificate craze 
　　The growing tendency among college students to get all kinds of certificates has now evolved into a craze. Just randomly ask a student what he or she is busily engaged in doing, quite possibly, you would get the answer that he or she is preparing for a certificate of some kind. So, why's the craze? 
　　The reason behind this phenomenon is common — the enormous pressure of finding a job. Faced with a harsh job market, most students have no choice but to seek more certificates to parlay their qualifications. Another factor is that diploma and certificates still weighs heavily in terms of signifying one's ability. For the sake of increasing their odds of landing a better job, the students are compelled to run from one exam to another. 
　　Though I have an open mind toward the craze on certificates, I suggest that students should be more rational when it comes to certificates, since they do not necessarily tell their ability. Instead, they should be more involved in learning and capability boosting, thus, opportunities would come quite naturally. 
　　　高分版  Certificate craze 
　　Recently the phenomenon of certificate craze has become a big concern of the public. It is also a new craze in the university, which seems like a routine activity on campus, for certificates do play a vital role when students look for a decent job. 
　　Admittedly, there are different purposes behind this phenomenon. Some people aim at certificates because of the employment pressure. With the admission expansion of colleges, a great many graduates have to face the fierce competition in the job market. So it is the certificates that can make them more competitive. However, some others consider all the diploma and certificates important standards by which a person's ability can be measured. They spare no effort to get the certificates for the sole purpose of proving that they are qualified in a certain field. Moreover, there are those who just want to enrich their life by preparing for the certificates because they really enjoy their progress. 
　　From my point of view, we should be more rational when it comes to certificates, since certificates do not necessarily prove one's ability. Being crazy in getting certifications blindly is nothing but wasting time. To conclude, we should focus on improving our ability but not merely getting a certificate. 
　　外教版 
　　The job market today is increasingly sophisticated, requiring workers to have specialized knowledge in their fields. As a result, becoming certified is a trend among today's job seeking youth. More and more people, students especially, look at obtaining certification as a means to getting a better job and, therefore, enjoying brighter future.
　　There are as many certificates as there are fields of study. Lawyers will take the LSAT, business majors will take the GMAT to further their study in the , and those who study a foreign language, like English, might take the TOEFL, TOEIC, or any number of English certification exams. 
　　Is this necessary? Or, is the “certification craze” just a trend that will eventually pass? I myself have obtained two different certifications: one in Japanese (N2) and another in teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL). Both of these certifications have been beneficial in getting good jobs. 
　　Therefore, it is my opinion that, trend or not, the results of becoming certified are real and can be invaluable in opening up future opportunities.

　　Somehow the old male and female stereotypes no longer fit. Men and women in this country haven't been fulfilling their traditional roles for some time now. And there seem to be fewer and fewer differences between the sexes. For instance, even though more women than men are still homemakers without paying jobs, women have been taking over more responsibility in the business world, earning higher salaries than ever before and entering fields of work that used to be exclusively male areas. At office meetings and in group discussions, they might speak up more often, express strong opinions and come up with more creative and practical ideas than their male colleagues. Several days ago, my 23-year-old daughter came to me with some important news. Not only had she found the highest paying job of her career, but she'd also accepted a date with the most charming men she'd ever met.
　　“Really?” I responded,” tell me about them.”
　　“Receptionist in an attorney's office and a welder at a construction site.” She answered in a matter-of-fact way. The interesting thing is my daughter's date is the receptionist and my daughter is the welder. The old stereotypes of men's and women's work have been changing more quickly than ever before, except perhaps in my own marriage.
　　“Who's going to mow the lawn?” I asked my husband this morning.
　　“Oh, I will,” he answered politely. ”That's men's work.”
　　“What?” Irritated, I raised my voice. “That's a ridiculous stereotype. I'll show you who can do the best job on the lawn.”
　　The work took 3 hours and I did it all myself.

　　Florence Hayes is a journalist for the Green Ville Journal, the daily newspaper in town. Specifically she covers crime in the Green Ville area. This responsibility takes her too many different places every week——the police station, the court and the hospital. Most of the crimes that she writes about fall into two groups: violent crimes and crimes against property. There isn't much violent crime in a small town like Green Ville, or at least not as much as in the large urban areas. But assaults often occur on Friday and Saturday nights, near the bars downtown. There're also one or two rapes on campus every semester.  is very interested in this type of crime and tries to write a long article about each one. She expects that this will make women more careful when they walk around Green Ville alone at night
　　Fortunately, there were usually no murders in Green Ville. Crimes against property make up most of Miss Heyse' reporting. They range from minor cases of deliberate damaging of things to much more serious offenses, such as car accidents involving drunk drivers or bank robberies but Florence has to report all of these violations from the thief who took typewriters from every unlock room in the dormitory to the thief who stole one million dollars worth of art work from the university museum. Miss Hayes enjoys working for a newspaper but she sometimes gets unhappy about all the crime she has to report. She would prefer to start writing about something more interesting and less unpleasant such as local news or politics, maybe next year

　　In America, people are faced with more and more decisions every day, whether it's picking one of thirty-one ice cream flavors, or deciding whether and when to get married. That sounds like a great thing, but as a recent study has shown, too many choices can make us confused, unhappy, even paralyzed with indecision. ‘That's particularly true when it comes to the work place', says Barry Schwartz, an author of six books about human behavior. Students are graduating with a variety of skills and interests, but often find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to choosing an ultimate career goal. In a study, Schwartz observed decision-making among college students during their senior year. Based on answers to questions regarding their job hunting strategies and career decisions, he divided the students into two groups：Maximizes, who consider every possible option, and satisfiers who look until they find an option that is good enough. You might expect that the student who had undertaken the most exhausted search would be the most satisfied with their final decision, but it turns out that's not true. Schwartz found that while maximizes ended up with better-paying jobs than satisfiers on average, they weren't as happy with their decision. The reason why these people feel less satisfied is that a world of possibilities may also be a world of missed opportunities. When you look at every possible option, you tend to focus more on what was given up than what was gained. After surveying every option, a person is more acutely aware of the opportunities they had to turn down to pursue just one career.

What he was most interested in, he began, was stillness and quiet.A few months later, I read an interview with the well-known cutting-edge designer Philippe Starck.What allowed him to remain so consistently ahead of the curve? “I never read any magazines or watch TV,” he said, perhaps with a little exaggeration. “Nor do I go to cocktail parties, dinners or anything like that.” He lived outside conventional ideas, he implied, because “I live alone mostly, in the middle of nowhere.”Around the same time, I noticed that those who part with $ night to stay in a cliff-top room at the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, California, pay partly for the privilege of not having a TV in their rooms; the future of travel, I’m reliably told, lies in “black-hole resorts,” which charge high prices precisely because you can’t get online in their rooms.Has it really come to this?The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug. Internet rescue camps in  and  try to save kids addicted to the screen.Writer friends of mine pay good money to get the Freedom software that enables them to disable the very Internet connections that seemed so emancipating not long ago. Even Intel experimented in 2007 with conferring four uninterrupted hours of quiet time (no phone or e-mail) every Tuesday morning on 300 engineers and managers. Workers were not allowed to use the phone or send e-mail, but simply had the chance to clear their heads and to hear themselves think.The average American spends at least eight and a half hours a day in front of a screen, Nicholas Carr notes in his book The Shallows. The average American teenager sends or receives 75 text messages a day, though one girl managed to handle an average of 10,000 every 24 hours for a month.Since luxury is a function of scarcity, the children of tomorrow will long for nothing more than intervals of freedom from all the blinking machines, streaming videos and scrolling headlines that leave them feeling empty and too full all at once.The urgency of slowing down—to find the time and space to think—is nothing new, of course, and wiser souls have always reminded us that the more attention we pay to the moment, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context. “Distraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries,” the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century, “and yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.” He also famously remarked that all of man’s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.When telegraphs and trains brought in the idea that convenience was more important than content, Henry David Thoreau reminded us that “the man whose horse trots (奔跑), a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages.”Marshall McLuhan, who came closer than most to seeing what was coming, warned, “When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.”We have more and more ways to communicate, but less and less to say. Partly because we are so busy communicating. And we are rushing to meet so many deadlines that we hardly register that what we need most are lifelines.So what to do? More and more people I know seem to be turning to yoga, or meditation (沉思), or tai chi (太极)；these aren’t New Age fads (时尚的事物) so much as ways to connect with what could be called the wisdom of old age. Two friends of mine observe an “Internet sabbath (安息日)” every week, turning off their online connections from Friday night to Monday morning. Other friends take walks and “forget” their cellphones at home.A series of tests in recent years has shown, Mr. Carr points out, that after spending time in quiet rural settings, subjects “exhibit greater attentiveness, stronger memory and generally improved cognition. Their brains become both calmer and sharper.” More than that, empathy (同感，共鸣)，as well as deep thought, depends (as neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have found) on neural processes that are “inherently slow.”I turn to eccentric measures to try to keep my mind sober and ensure that I have time to do nothing at all (which is the only time when I can see what I should be doing the rest of the time).I have yet to use a cellphone and I have never Tweeted or entered Facebook. I try not to go online till my day’s writing is finished, and I moved from Manhattan to rural Japan in part so I could more easily survive for long stretches entirely on foot.None of this is a matter of asceticism (苦行主义)；it is just pure selfishness. Nothing makes me feel better than being in one place, absorbed in a book, a conversation, or music. It is actually something deeper than mere happiness: it is joy, which the monk (僧侣) David Steindl-Rast describes as “that kind of happiness that doesn’t depend on what happens.”It is vital, of course, to stay in touch with the world. But it is only by having some distance from the world that you can see it whole, and understand what you should be doing with it.For more than 20 years, therefore, I have been going several times a year—often for no longer than three days—to a Benedictine hermitage (修道院)，40 minutes down the road, as it happens, from the Post Ranch Inn. I don’t attend services when I am there, and I have never meditated, there or anywhere; I just take walks and read and lose myself in the stillness, recalling that it is only by stepping briefly away from my wife and bosses and friends that I will have anything useful to bring to them. The last time I was in the hermitage, three months ago, I happened to meet with a youngish-looking man with a 3-year-old boy around his shoulders.“You’re Pico, aren’t you?” the man said, and introduced himself as Larry; we had met, I gathered, 19 years before, when he had been living in the hermitage as an assistant to one of the monks.“What are you doing now?” I asked.We smiled. No words were necessary.“I try to bring my kids here as often as I can,” he went on. The child of tomorrow, I realized, may actually be ahead of us, in terms of sensing not what is new, but what is essential.1.

What does the author say about yoga, meditation and tai chi?A) They help people understand ancient wisdom.B) They contribute to physical and mental health.C) They are ways to communicate with nature.D) They keep people from various distractions.6. What is neuroscientist Antonio Damasio’s finding?A) Quiet rural settings contribute a lot to long life.B) One’s brain becomes sharp when it is activated.C) Eccentric measures are needed to keep one’s mind sober.D) When people think deeply, their neural processes are slow.7.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2. Questions 47 to 54 are based on the following passage.A key process in interpersonal interaction is that of social comparison, in that we evaluate ourselves in terms of how we compare to others. In particular, we engage in two types of comparison. First, we decide whether we are superior or inferior to others on certain dimensions, such as attractiveness, intelligence, popularity, etc. Here, the important aspect is to compare with an appropriate reference group. For example, modest joggers should not compare their performance with Olympic standard marathon (马拉松) runners. Second, we judge the extent to which we are the same as or different from others. At certain stages of life, especially adolescence, the pressure to be seen as similar to peers is immense. Thus, wearing the right brand of clothes or shoes may be of the utmost importance. We also need to know whether our thoughts, beliefs and ideas are in line with those of other people. This is part of the process of self-validation whereby we employ self-disclosures to seek support for our self-concept.People who do not have access to a good listener may not only be denied the opportunity to heighten their self-awareness, but they are also denied valuable feedback as to the validity and acceptability of their inner thoughts and feelings. By discussing these with others, we receive feedback as to whether these are experiences which others have as well, or whether they are less common. Furthermore, by gauging the reactions to our self-disclosures we learn what types are acceptable or unacceptable with particular people and in specific situations. On occasions it is the fear that certain disclosures may be unacceptable to family or friends that motivates an individual to seek professional help. Counsellors will be familiar with client statements such as: “I just couldn’t talk about this to my husband.”, “I really can’t let my mother know my true feelings.” Another aspect of social comparison in the counselling context relates to a technique known as normalising. This is the process whereby helpers provide reassurance to clients that what they are experiencing is not abnormal or atypical (非典型的), but is a normal reaction shared by others when facing such circumstances. Patient disclosure, facilitated by the therapist, seems also to facilitate the process of normalising. 47. To evaluate ourselves, the author thinks it important for us to compare ourselves with _______.48. During adolescence, people generally feel an immense pressure to appear _______.49. It is often difficult for people to heighten their self-awareness without _______.50. What can people do if they find what they think or say unacceptable to family or friends?51. Counsellors often assure their clients that what they experience themselves is only _______. Section BDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A）, B）, C） and D）. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage. Amid all the job losses, there’s one category of worker that the economic disruption has been good for: nonhumans.From self-service checkout lines at the supermarket to industrial robots armed with saws and taught to carve up animal bodies in slaughter-houses, these ever-more-intelligent machines are now not just assisting workers but actually kicking them out of their jobs.Automation isn’t just affecting factory workers, either. Some law firms now use artificial intelligence software to scan and read mountains of legal documents, work that previously was performed by highly-paid human lawyers.“Robots continue to have an impact on blue-collar jobs, and white-collar jobs are under attack by microprocessors,” says economics professor Edward Leamer. The recession permanently wiped out 2.5 million jobs.  gross domestic product has climbed back to pre-recession levels, meaning we’re producing as much as before, only with 6% fewer workers. To be sure, robotics are not the only job killers out there, with outsourcing (外包) stealing far more jobs than automation.    Jeff Burnstein, president of the Robotics Industry Association, argues that robots actually save  jobs. His logic: companies that embrace automation might use fewer workers, but that’s still better than firing everyone and moving the work overseas.It’s not that robots are cheaper than humans, though often they are. It’s that they’re better. “In some cases the quality requirements are so exacting that even if you wanted to have a human do the job, you couldn’t,” Burnstein says.Same goes for surgeons, who’re using robotic systems to perform an ever-growing list of operations—not because the machines save money but because, thanks to the greater precision of robots, the patients recover in less time and have fewer complications, says Dr. Myriam Curet.    Surgeons may survive the robot invasion, but others at the hospital might not be so lucky, as iRobot, maker of the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner, has been showing off Ava, which could be used as a messenger in a hospital. And once you’re home, recovering, Ava could let you talk to your doctor, so there’s no need to send someone to your house. That “mobile telepresence” could be useful at the office. If you’re away on a trip, you can still attend a meeting. Just connect via videoconferencing software, so your face appears on Ava’s screen.    Is any job safe? I was hoping to say “journalist,” but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story. Which means that a few years from now, a robot could be writing this column. And who will read it? Well, there might be a lot of us hanging around with lots of free time on our hands. 注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。 52.

What does the author imply about robotics?A) It will greatly enrich literary creation.B) It will start a new technological revolution.C) It will revolutionize scientific research.D) It will be applied in any field imaginable.  Passage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.You’ve now heard it so many times, you can probably repeat it in your sleep. President Obama will no doubt make the point publicly when he gets to : the Chinese need to consume more; they need—believe it or not—to become more like Americans, for the sake of the global economy.And it’s all true. But the other side of that equation is that the  needs to save more. For the moment, American households actually are doing so. After the personal-savings rate dipped to zero in 2005, the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets.In , the household-savings rate exceeds 20%. It is partly for policy reasons. As we’ve seen, wage earners are expected to care for not only their children but their aging parents. And there is, to date, only the flimsiest (脆弱的) of publicly-funded health care and pension systems, which increases incentives for individuals to save while they are working. But China is a society that has long esteemed personal financial prudence (谨慎). There is no chance that will change anytime soon, even if the government creates a better social safety net and successfully encourages greater consumer spending.Why does the U.S. need to learn a little frugality (节俭)？Because healthy savings rates are one of the surest indicators of a country’s long-term financial health. High savings lead, over time, to increased investment, which in turn generates productivity gains, innovation and job growth. In short, savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest.The  government thus needs to act as well. By running constant deficits, it is dis-saving, even as households save more. Peter Orszag, Obama’s Budget Director, recently called the  budget deficits unsustainable and he’s right. To date, the  has seemed unable to see the consequences of spending so much more than is taken in. That needs to change. And though Hu Jintao and the rest of the Chinese leadership aren’t inclined to lecture visiting Presidents, he might gently hint that  is getting a little nervous about the value of the dollar—which has fallen 15% since March, in large part because of increasing fears that ’s debt load is becoming unmanageable.That’s what happens when you’re the world’s biggest creditor: you get to drop hints like that, which would be enough by themselves to create international economic chaos if they were ever leaked. (Every time any official in  deliberates publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion  holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack.) If Americans saved more and spent less, consistently over time, they wouldn’t have to worry about all that.  57. How did the economic crisis affect Americans?A) They had to tighten their belts.B) Their bank savings rate dropped to zero.C) Their leadership in the global economy was shaken.D) They became concerned about ’s financial policy. 58. What should be done to encourage Chinese people to consume?A) Changing their traditional way of life.B) Providing fewer incentives for saving.C) Improving ’s social security system.D) Cutting down the expenses on child-rearing. 59. What does the author mean by saying “savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest” (Line 4, Para. 4)?A) The more one saves, the more returns one will reap.B) A country’s economy hinges on its savings policy.C) Those who keep saving will live an easy life in the end.D) A healthy savings rate promotes economic prosperity.  60. In what circumstances do currency traders become scared?A) When  allows its currency exchange rates to float.B) When  starts to reduce its current foreign reserves.C) When  talks about switching its dollar reserves to other currencies.D) When  mentions in public the huge debts  owes . 61. What is the author’s purpose of writing the passage?A) To urge the American government to cut deficits.B) To encourage Chinese people to spend more.C) To tell Americans not to worry about their economy.D) To promote understanding between  and .  Part V                                  Cloze （15 minutes）Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

　　（1）It is believed that the computer can do almost every thing. At the time the computer was invented, scientists, carried away by its calculating speed, felt that they had created a miracle. It was gradually used not only in mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy, but in places like the library, hospital and military army to replace the work of man. For the work of man. For this reason, the computer was entiled “Electronic Brain” in terms of appreciation。
　　Can man be controlled by computers? The answer is negative. Although a computer works much faster and accurately than man , a fact is undeniable; it is designed, manufactured and programmed by man, and therefore by human beings. Of course, science fictions have made up many fascinating stories about a computer, or rather robot, who conquers man and the earth, even the whole universe; however, they are only unrealistic imaginatio. A horse helps man a lot runs much faster than we, but it is only a slave。
　　The future for the computer is very promising. With the help of it, we can do things that could not be done before. Conquering the universe, discovering new things, explaining mysteruiys phenomena puzzling us at present are all made possible by computer。
    （2）It is believed that the computer is bringing the world into a brand new era. At the time the computer was invented, scientists, marveling at its calculating speed, felt that they had created a miracle. Nowadays, the function of the computer is no longer confined to calculation; it permeates people’s daily lives and has become an inseparable part of human society.
     People become so heavily dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine the life without computers. Therefore, some people are worried that “The real danger is not that the computer will think like man, but man will think like the computer.”
Their concern does make sense. Indeed, some people spend such a long time working on computers that they have few interactions with people in real life. According to a research, too many hours in front of a computer may lead to a poker face and interpersonal isolation. This fact should arouse our attention, because unlike computers, human beings are social creatures that need emotional connections with others.
     Yet, it is also unnecessary for us to be overwhelmed by the negative impacts of computers. After all, we humans are intelligent and will be able to figure out better ways to make improvements.Ⅱ【】      1. There is no access to television in its rooms.

Conversation One
　　W: I don’t know what to do. I can’t seem to get anyone in the hospital to listen to my complaints and this outdated equipment is dangerous. Just look at it.
　　M: Hmm, uh, are you trying to say that it presents a health hazard?
　　W: Yes, I am. The head technician in the lab tried to persuade the hospital administration to replace it, but they are trying to cut costs.
　　M: You are pregnant, aren’t you?
　　W: Yes, I am. I made an effort to get my supervisor to transfer me to another department, but he urged me not to complain too loudly. Because the administration is more likely to replace me than an X-ray equipment, I’m afraid to refuse to work. But I’m more afraid to expose my unborn child to the radiation.
　　M: I see what you mean. Well, as your union representative, I have to warn you that it would take quite a while to force management to replace the old machines and attempt to get you transferred may or may not be successful.
　　W: Oh, what am I supposed to do then?
　　M: Workers have the legal right to refuse certain unsafe work assignments under two federal laws, the Occupation or Safety and Health Act and the National Labor Relations Act. But the requirements of either of the Acts may be difficult to meet.
　　W: Do you think I have a good case?
　　M: If you do lose your job, the union will fight to get it back for you along with back pay, your lost income. But you have to be prepared for a long wait, maybe after two years.
　　Q19. What does the woman complain about?
　　Q20. What has the woman asked her supervisor to do?
　　Q21. What does the man say about the two federal laws?
　　Q22. What will the union do if the woman loses her job?
　　【答案】
　　19. The health hazard at her work place.
　　20. Transfer her to another department.
　　21. Their requirements may be difficult to meet.
　　22. Try to help her to get it back.
　　【点评】
　　本篇长对话是关于一名怀孕的员工就工作中的辐射伤害向工会投诉。对话一开篇女士先抱怨自己工作的医院无人听她申诉有关机器已过时，会造成身体伤害的问题，因为医院想要降低成本。然后她提到自己有向主管提出转调部门的要求，然而遭到拒绝。主管还告诫她，医院宁愿换掉她，让他人工作，也不会更换机器。于是工会代表告诉她转调部门确实可能不会成功。同时要想利用目前的法案来解决这一问题，也会很难实现。最后指出，除非她真正丢失工作，工会才能拿起法律武器帮她讨薪。
　　本对话考生虽然对辐射造成身体伤害的话题并不陌生，但整个对话中部分单词可能还是会造成不少听力困扰。比如：health hazard（健康伤害）中的hazard；X-ray equipment（X光仪器）中的X-ray和两大法案的名称虽不难，但也容易混淆大家的视听，而误抓重点。

　　Conversation Two
　　W: Mr. Green, is it fair to say that negotiation is an art?
　　M: Well, I think it’s both an art and science. You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically, but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one’s artistic quality. The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects.
　　W: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects?
　　M: Well, that’s I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor. You can pretend that you don’t like things which you are actually quite pleased about. Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who’s known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight. But the artistic part of negotiation I think has to do with responding immediately to cues one gets in the process of negotiation. These can be verbal cues or even body language. This is where the artistic quality comes in.
　　W: So really, you see two types of negotiator then, the actor or the honest one.
　　M: That’ right. And both can work. I would say the honest negotiator can be quite effective in some circumstances. In other circumstances you need an actor.
　　Q23. When is a scientific approach best embodied in a negotiation according to the man?
　　Q24. In what way is a negotiator like an actor according to the man?
　　Q25. What does the man say about the two types of negotiator?
　　【答案】
　　23. In the preparatory phase.
　　24. He behaves in a way contrary to his real intention.
　　25. Both can succeed depending on the specific situation.
　　【点评】
　　本长对话主要是关于谈判的艺术性和科学性。谈判的科学性部分主要体现在谈判策略，而谈判的艺术性则体现在表现上。这里可以归为两类，一是“演技派”，二是“诚实派”。另外，谈判的艺术性还与对谈判过程中获得的口头暗示、肢体语言进行及时反应有关。最后男士指出根据不同场合，无论是“诚实派”，或是“演技派”谈判者都能起到各自的效果。
　　本对话中的关键词有：negotiation：谈判；strategy：策略；behavioral：行为的。
　　Section B
　　Passage 1
　　A scientific team is studying the thinking ability of eleven and half month old children. The test is a simple one. The baby watches a sort of show on a small stage. In Act One of the show, a yellow cube is lifted from a blue box, and moved across the stage. Then it is returned to the box. This is repeated 6 times. Act Two is similar except that the yellow cube is smaller. Baby boys do not react at all to the difference and the size of the cube. But girls immediately become excited. The scientists interpret the girls’ excitement as meaning they are trying to understand what they have just seen. They are wondering why Act Two is odd and how it differs from Act One. In other words, the little girls are reasoning. This experiment certainly does not definitely prove that girls start to reason before boys, but it provides a clue that scientists would like to study more carefully. Already it is known that bones, muscles and nerves develop faster in baby girls. Perhaps it is early nerve development that makes some infant girls show more intelligence than infant boys. Scientists have also found that nature seems to give another boost to girls. Baby girls usually talk at an earlier age than boys do. Scientists think that there is a physical reason for this. They believe that the nerve endings in the left side of the brain develop faster in girls than in boys, and it is this side of the brain that strongly influences an individual’s ability to use language and remember things.
　　Q26. What is the difference between Act One and Act Two in the test?
　　答案：The size of the objects shown.
　　Q27. How do the scientists interpret their observation from the experiment?
　　答案： Girls seem to start reasoning earlier than boys.
　　Q28. What does the speaker say about the experiment?
　　答案： It may simulate scientists to make further studies.
　　Q29. According to scientists, what is another advantage given to girls by nature?
　　答案： They talk at an early age.

　　Passage 2
　　A super attendant of the city municipal building, Dillia Adorno, was responsible for presenting its new security plan to the public. City employees, citizens and reporters gathered in the hall to hear her describe the plan. After outlining the main points she would cover, she assured the audience that she would be happy to answer questions at the end of her presentation. Dillia realized the plan was expensive and potentially controversial. So she was not surprised to see a number of hands go up as soon as she finished speaking. An employ asked, “Would the new system create long lines to get into the building like the line in the airport security checks?” Dillia had anticipated this question and had an answer ready. After repeating the question, she explained that the sufficient number of security guards would be working at peak hours to speed things along. The next question was more confrontational.”Where was the money come from to pay for all of this?”The journalists who ask the question seem hostile. But Dillia was careful not to adopt the defensive tone. She stated that the money would come from the city’s general budget. “I know these are tide times”, she added, “But everyone agrees on the importance of safe guarding our employees and members of the public who come into the building.” Near the end of the 25 minutes she has said, Dillia said she would take two more questions. When those were finished, she concluded the session with a brief restatement of how the new system will improve security and peace of mind in the municipal building.
　　Question 30 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
　　30. What is the focus of Dillia Adorno’s presentation?
　　答案：The new security plan for the municipal building.
　　31. What question had Dillia Adorno anticipated?
　　答案： Whether the security checks would create long queues at peak hours.
　　32. What did the speakers think of the question from the journalist?
　　答案： Confrontational
　　【点评】
　　本文描写一位政府官员介绍了一项新的安保计划，并回答了在场人员的提问，类似于一场新闻发布会。计划成本较高，而且可能颇具争议。本文详细阐述了两个提问。第一个问题是Dillia预见到的，但第二个记者的提问是有对抗性的，即使confrontational这个词我们听不懂也没关系，可以从下文的其他词汇中推断，如hostile 有敌意的，而针对这个问题，Dillia让自己尽可能不采取defensive的态度，既然要采取防卫的态度，那记者的提问一定是在政府的对立面的，因此从defensive一词也可以判断出记者的态度。
　　关键词：attendant n. 随员 confrontational adj. 对抗性的 hostile，defensive
　　Passage 3
　　Despite unemployment and the lost of her home, Andrea Clark considers herself a blessed and happy woman. Why the cheerful attitude? Her troubles have brought her closer to her family. Last year, Andrea’s husband, Rick, a miner in  was laid off. Though Andrea kept her job as a school bus driver, she knew that they couldn’t pay their bill and support their youngest of five children, Zack, age nine, on one income. “At first their church helped out, but you can’t keep that up forever”, Andrea says. Then Michal, their eldest of her four adult children suggested they move in with his family. For almost three months, seven  lived under one roof. Andrea, Rick and Zack stayed in the basement department, sharing laundry and single bathroom with Michal, his wife and their two children.
　　The change cut their expenditures in half, but the new living arrangement proved too challenging. When Andrea found a job with a school district closer to her mother’s home in west , the family decided to move on. Packing up again with no picnic, Zack had to switch schools for the second time and space is even tighter. Andrea says that the moves themselves are exhausting and Rick is still looking for a job.
　　The recession has certainly come with more problems than Andrea anticipated, but she remains unfailingly optimistic. She is excited to spend more time with her mother. Another plus, rents are lower in  than in . So Andrea thinks they’ll be able to save up and move out in less than 6 months.

　　Section C
　　Mountain climbing is becoming a popular sport, but it is also a potentially dangerous one. People can fall. They may also become ill. One of the most common dangers to climbers is altitude sickness, which can affect even very experienced climbers. Altitude sickness usually begins when a climber goes above 8,000 to 9,000 feet. The higher one climbs, the less oxygen there is in the air. When people don’t get enough oxygen, they often begin to gasp for air. They may also feel dizzy and light-headed. Besides these symptoms of altitude sickness, others such as headache and fatigue may also occur. At heights of over 18,000 feet, people may be climbing in a constant daze. Their state of mind can have adverse affect on their judgment. A few precautions can help most climbers avoid altitude sickness. The first is not to go too high, too fast. If you climb to 10,000 feet, stay at that height for a day or two. Your body needs to get used to a high altitude before you climb to a even higher one. Or if you do climb higher sooner, come back down to a lower height when you sleep. Also, drink plenty of liquids and avoid tobacco and alcohol. When you reach your top height, do like activities rather than sleep too much. You breathe less when you sleep, so you get less oxygen. The most important warning is this: if you have severe symptoms, then don’t go away, go down. Don’t risk injury or death because of over-confidence or lack of knowledge.

　　Amid all the job losses of the Great Recession, there is one category of worker that the economic disruption has been good for: nonhumans.
　　From self-service checkout lines at the supermarket to industrial robots armed with saws and taught to carve up animal carcasses in slaughter-houses, these ever-more-intelligent machines are now not just assisting workers but actually kicking them out of their jobs.
　　Automation isn’t just affecting factory workers, either. Some law firms now use artificial intelligence software to scan and read mountains of legal documents, work that previously was performed by highly paid human lawyers.
　　“Robots continue to have an impact on blue-collar jobs, and white-collar jobs are under attack by microprocessors,” says Edward Leamer, an economics professor at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management and director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, a survey of the  and  economies. Leamer says the recession permanently wiped out 2.5 million jobs.  gross domestic product has climbed back to pre-recession levels, meaning we’re producing as much as before, only with 6 percent fewer workers. To be sure, robotics are not the only job killers out there, with outsourcing stealing far more gigs than automation.
　　Jeff Burnstein, president of the Robotics Industry Association, a trade group in , , argues that robots actually save  jobs. His logic: companies that embrace automation might use fewer workers, but that’s still better than firing everyone and moving the work overseas.
　　It’s not that robots are cheaper than humans, though often they are. It’s that they are better. “In some cases the quality requirements are so stringent that even if you wanted to have a human do the job, you couldn’t,” Burnstein says.
　　Same goes for surgeons, who are using robotic systems to perform an ever-growing list of operations—not because the machines save money but because, thanks to the greater precision of robots, the patients recover in less time and have fewer complications, says Dr. Myriam Curet.
　　Surgeons may survive the robot invasion, but others at the hospital might not be so lucky, as iRobot, maker of the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner, has been showing off Ava, a three-foot-tall droid on wheels that carries a tablet computer. iRobot reckons Ava could be used as a courier in a hospital. And once you’re home, recovering, Ava could let you talk to your doctor, so there’s no need to send someone to your house. That “mobile telepresence” could be useful at the office. If you’re away on a trip, you can still attend a meeting. Just connect via videoconferencing software, so your face appears on Ava’s screen.
　　Is any job safe? I was hoping to say “journalist,” but researchers are already developing algorithms that can gather facts and write a news story. Which means that a few years from now, a robot could be writing this column. And who will read it? Well, there might be a lot of us hanging around with lots of free time on our hands.
　　52. What do we learn from the first few paragraphs?
　　答案：The robotic industry has benefited from the economic recession.
　　53. What caused the greatest loss of jobs in America?
　　答案：Moving production to other countries.
　　54. What does Jeff Burnstein say about robots?
　　答案：They compete with human workers.
　　55. What are robotic systems replacing surgeons in more and more operations according to Dr. Myriam Curet?
　　答案：They beat humans in precision.
　　56. What does the author imply about robotics?
　　答案：It will be applied in any field imaginable.
　　【解析】这是一篇讨论机器人取代人类的科技说明文，话题是考生比较熟悉的科技类文章。文中指出在大萧条时期众多失业的情况下，有一类工人却受益于经济混乱：机器人。机器人和业务外包比自动化分流了更多的岗位。但是专家指出，并不是因为机器人比人廉价，而是它们比人类更优秀。在很多具体工作上，人类无法做到像机器人那样精确。文章最后一段探讨还有那些岗位能免于机器人取代的危机，作者本以为记者行业可以，但是结果却不是这样，几乎所有岗位都面临这种趋势，从而紧扣文章原文题目和主题：Who Needs Humans?人类还有何用？
　　本文选材虽然是科技相关，但是词汇都比较简单，没有太偏的词汇。而这几道题相比而言，难度又低了不少，很多选项直接可以通过对比原文排除，如54题谈到对机器人的看法，其中B选项说机器人比人类工作更省钱更便宜，而文中已经特别清晰的表明立场，It’s not that …此外，词汇复现也能帮助大家准备做对题目，如第52题的答案中benefit from就对应了原文中的be good for，所以很快很轻松的就选出来了。因此考生只要明确文中几个人物各自的观点，勾画好关键词，整体上来讲，5道题都做对基本可以做到的。
　　深度阅读SB_2
　　You've now heard it so many times, you can probably repeat it in your sleep. President Obama will no doubt make the point publicly when he gets to Beijing: the Chinese need to spend more; they need to consume more; they need — believe it or not — to become more like Americans, for the sake of the global economy.
　　And it's all true. But the other side of that equation is that the  needs to save more. For the moment, American households actually are doing so. After the personal-savings rate dipped to zero in 2005, the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets.
　　In , the household-savings rate exceeds 20%. It is partly for policy reasons. As we've seen, wage earners are expected to care for not only their children but also their aging parents. And there is, to date, only the flimsiest（脆弱的） of publicly-funded health care and pension systems, which increases incentives for individuals to save while they are working. But China is a society that has long esteemed personal financial prudence（谨慎）for centuries. There is no chance that will change anytime soon, even if the government creates a better social safety net and successfully encourages greater consumer spending.
　　Why does the U.S. need to learn a little frugality(节俭). Because healthy savings rates are one of the surest indicators of a country's long-term financial health. High savings lead, over time, to increased investment, which in turn generates productivity gains, innovation and job growth. In short, savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest.
　　The  government thus needs to act as well. By running constant deficits, it is dis-saving, even as households save more. Peter Orszag, Obama's Budget Director, recently called the  budget deficits unsustainable and he's right. To date, the  has seemed unable to have what Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels has called an "adult conversation" about the consequences of spending so much more than is taken in. That needs to change. And though Hu Jintao and the rest of the Chinese leadership aren't inclined to lecture visiting Presidents, he might gently hint that Beijing is getting a little nervous about the value of the dollar — which has fallen 15% since March, in large part because of increasing fears that America's debt load is becoming unmanageable.
　　That's what happens when you're the world's biggest creditor: you get to drop hints like that, which would be enough by themselves to create international economic chaos if they were ever leaked. (Every time any official in Beijing deliberately publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion China holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack.) If Americans saved more and spent less, consistently over time, they wouldn't have to worry about all that.
　　【点评】
　　本文讲述了在全球经济危机的背景下，美国人要向中国人学习勤俭，学会储蓄。为什么这样做呢？文章中指出良好的储蓄率能够推动经济的繁荣。但即使美国家庭开始储蓄更多，如果政府常年赤字的话，对美国来说还是“反储蓄”的。所以文章的目的是敦促美国政府降低赤字，并在文末再一次强调要坚持向中国学习存多花少，
　　57. How did the economic crisis affect Americans?
　　They had to tighten their belts.
　　【解析】细节题。从原文第二段最后一句话“the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets”可见，经济危机使得美国民众关紧钱包，即少花钱，也就是答案中tighten their belts（勒紧腰带，节省开支）的意思。所以正确答案为A。
　　58. What should be done to encourage Chinese people to consume?
　　Improving China’s social security system.
　　【解析】细节题。从原文中的“even if the government creates a better social safety net and successfully encourages greater consumer spending”可见，如要鼓励中国人消费更多，这需要提高社会安全系统。
　　59. What does the author mean by saying “savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest” (Line 4, Para. 4)?
　　A healthy savings rate promotes economic prosperity.
　　【解析】细节题。根据题干提示，定位至第四段最后一句，我们发现这句话是前面几句话的概括，那根据前面“High savings lead, over time, to increased investment, which in turn generates productivity gains, innovation and job growth.”可知，高储蓄率能够促进投资，进而促进生产率、创新和岗位增长，即促进经济的繁荣。所以正确答案为D。
　　60. In what circumstances do currency traders become scared?
　　When Beijing mentions in public the huge debts America owes China.
　　【解析】细节题。从原文中的“Every time any official in Beijing deliberately publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion China holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack.”可知，每当中国政府公开提到美国欠我国的大量债务，货币交易员们就担惊受怕。因为本段一开始提到作为最大的债权国，财政上的漏洞会造成经济的混乱。所以正确答案为D。
　　61. What is the author’s purpose of writing the passage?
　　To urge the American government to cut defictis.
　　【解析】主旨题。纵观全文，作者一直在强调美国应该向中国学习勤俭，文中第五段的第一句话“By running constant deficits, it is dis-saving, even as households save more.”也给到我们提示，既然长期运行赤字是不利于储蓄的，那美国政府应该做的是降低赤字。所以正确答案是A。Ⅴ【完形填空】

A number of innovative colleges are making the same offer to students anxious about saving time and money. That’s both an opportunity and a warning for the best higher-education system in the world.　　The  has almost all of the world’s best universities. A recent Chinese survey ranks 35 American universities among the top 50, eight among the top 10. Our research universities have been the key to developing the competitive advantages that help Americans produce 25% of all the world’s wealth. In 2007, 623,805 of the world’s brightest students were attracted to American universities.　　Yet, there are signs of peril (危险)within American higher education.  colleges have to compete in the marketplace. Students may choose among 6,000 public, private, nonprofit, for profit, or religious institutions of higher learning. In addition, almost all of the 532 billion the federal government provides for university research is awarded competitively.　　But many colleges and universities are stuck in the past. For instance, the idea of the fall-to-spring“school year”hasn’t changed much since before the American Revolution, when we were a summer stretch no longer makes sense. Former George Washington University president Stephen Trachtenberg estimates that a typical college uses its facilities for academic purposes a little more than half the calendar year.“While college facilities sit idle, they continue to generate maintenance expenses that contribute to the high cost of running a college,” he has written.　　Within academic departments, tenure(终身职位)，combined with age-discrimination laws, makes faculty turnover—critical for a university to remain current in changing times—difficult. Instead of protecting speech and encouraging diversity and innovative thinking, the tenure system often stifles(压制)them: younger professors must win the approval of established colleagues for tenure, encouraging like-mindedness and sometimes inhibiting the free flow of ideas.　　Meanwhile, tuition has soared, leaving graduating students with unprecedented loan debt. Strong campus presidents to manage these problems are becoming harder to find, and to keep. In fact, students now stay on campus almost as long as their presidents. The average amount of time students now take to complete an undergraduate degree has stretched to six years and seven months as students interrupted by work, inconvenienced by unavailable classes, or lured by one more football season find it hard to graduate.　　Congress has tried to help students with college costs through Pell Grants and other forms of tuition support. But some of their fixes have made the problem worse. The stack of congressional regulations governing federal student grants and loans now stands twice as tall as I do. Filling out these forms consumes 7% of every tuition dollar.　　For all of these reasons, some colleges like Hartwick are rethinking the old way of doing things and questioning decades-old assumptions about what a college degree means. For instance, why does it have to take four years to earn a diploma? This fall, 16 first-year students and four second-year students at Hartwick enrolled in the school’s new three year degree program. According to the college, the plan is designed for high-ability, highly motivated student who wish to save money or to move along more rapidly toward advanced degrees.　　By eliminating that extra year, there year degree students save 25% in costs. Instead of taking 30 credits a year, these students take 40. During January, Hartwick runs a four week course during which students may earn three to four credits on or off campus, including a number of international sites. Summer courses are not required, but a student may enroll in them—and pay extra. Three year students get first crack at course registration. There are no changes in the number of courses professors teach or in their pay.　　The three-year degree isn’t a new idea. Geniuses have always breezed through.  , a 350-student institution in , has offered students a three-year option for 40 years. Students attend “short terms” in May and June to earn the credits required for graduation.   in  and    in  are among other colleges offering three-year options.　　Changes at the high-school level are also helping to make it easier for many students to earn their undergraduate degrees in less time. One of five students arrives at college today with Advanced Placement (AP) credits amounting to a semester or more of college level work. Many universities, including large schools like the , make it easy for these AP students to graduate faster.　　For students who don’t plan to stop with an undergraduate degree, the three-year plan may have an even greater appeal. Dr. John Sergent, head of ’s residency (住院医生) program, enrolled in Vanderbilt’s undergraduate college in 1959. He entered medical school after only three years as did four or five of his classmates.” My first year of medical school counted as my senior year, which meant I had to take three to four labs a week to get all my sciences in. I basically skipped my senior year,” says Sergent. He still had time to be a student senator and meet his wife.　　There are, however, drawbacks to moving through school at such a brisk pace. For one, it deprives students of the luxury of time to roam (遨游) intellectually. Compressing everything into three years also leaves less time for growing up, engaging in extracurricular activities, and studying abroad. On crowded campuses it could mean fewer opportunities to get into a prized professor’s class. ’s  has graduated several hundred students in its three-year degree program, but it now phasing out the option. Most Waldorf students wanted the full four-year experience—academically, socially, and athletically. And faculty members will be wary of any change that threatens the core curriculum in the name of moving students into the workforce.　　“Most high governmental officials seem to conceive of education in this light—as a way to ensure economic competitiveness and continued economic growth,” Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, told The Washington Post. “I strongly disagree with this approach.” Another risk: the new campus schedules might eventually produce less revenue for the institution and longer working hours for faculty members.　　Adopting a three-year option will not come easily to most school. Those that wish to tackle tradition and make American campus more cost-conscious may find it easier to take Trachtenberg’s advice: open campuses year-round.“You could run two complete colleges, with two complete faculties,”he says.“That’s without cutting the length of students’ vacations, increasing class sizes, or requiring faculty to teach more.”　　Whether they experiment with three-year degrees, offer year-round classes, challenge the tenure system—or all of the above—universities are slowly realizing that to stay competitive and relevant they must adapt to a rapidly changing world.　　Expanding the three-year option may be difficult, but it may be less difficult than asking Congress for additional financial help, asking legislators for more state support, or asking students even higher tuition payments. Campuses willing to adopt convenient schedules along with more focused, less-expensive degrees may find that they have a competitive advantage in attracting bright, motivated students. These sorts of innovations can help American universities avoid the perils of success.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。　　1. Why did  start three-year degree programs?　　A) To create chances for the poor.

Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2　　Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.　　In face of global warming, much effort has been focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of strategies. But while much of the research and innovation has concentrated on finding less-polluting energy alternatives, it may be decades before clean technologies like wind and solar meet a significant portion of our energy needs.　　In the meantime, the amount of CO2 in the air is rapidly approaching the limits proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “As long as we’re consuming fossil fuels, we’re putting out CO2,”says Klaus Lackner, a geophysicist at , University” We cannot let the CO2 in the atmosphere rise indefinitely.”　　That sense of urgency has increased interest in capturing and storing CO2, which the IPCC says could provide the more than 50% reduction in emissions thought needed to reduce global warming.“We see the potential for capture and storage to play an integral role in reducing emissions,” says Kim Corley, Shell’s senior advisor of CO2 and environmental affairs. That forward thinking strategy is gaining support. The U.S. Department of Energy recently proposed putting $1 billion into a new $2.4 billion coal-burning energy plant. The plant’s carbon-capture technologies would serve as a pilot project for other new coal-burning plants.　　But what do you do with the gas once you’ve captured it? One option is to put it to new uses. Dakota Gasification of North Dakota captures CO2 at a plant that converts coal into synthetic natural gas. It then ships the gas 200 miles by pipeline to , where it is pumped underground in oil recovery operations. In the , Shell delivers CO2 to farmers who pipe it into their greenhouses, increasing their yield of fruits and vegetables.　　However, scientists say that the scale of CO2 emissions will require vast amounts of long-term storage. Some propose storing the CO2 in coal mines or liquid storage in the ocean, Shell favors storing CO2 in deep geological structures such as saline(盐的) formations and exhausted oil and gas fields that exist throughout the world.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　47.

You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.　　Passage One　　Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.　　As anyone who has tried to lose weight knows, realistic goal-setting generally produces the best results. That's partially because it appears people who set realistic goals actually work more efficiently, and exert more effort, to achieve those goals.　　What's far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting.　　Newspapers relay daily accounts of goal-setting prevalent in industries and businesses up and down both Wall Street and Main Street , yet there has been surprisingly little research on how the long-trumpeted practice of setting goals may have contributed to the current economic crisis , and unethical (不道德的)behavior in general.　　“Goals are widely used and promoted as having really beneficial effects. And yet, the same motivation that can push people to exert more effort in a constructive way could also motivate people to be more likely to engage in unethical behaviors,” says Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor at Penn’s .　　“It turns out there’s no economic benefit to just having a goal---you just get a psychological benefit” Schweitzer says. “But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful.”　　A prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues cite is the 2004 collapse of energy-trading giant Enron, where managers used financial incentives to motivate salesmen to meet specific revenue goals. The problem, Schweitzer says, is the actual trades were not profitable.　　Other studies have shown that saddling employees with unrealistic goals can compel them to lie, cheat or steal. Such was the case in the early 1990s when Sears imposed a sales quota on its auto repair staff. It prompted employees to overcharge for work and to complete unnecessary repairs on a companywide basis.　　Schweitzer concedes his research runs counter to a very large body of literature that commends the many benefits of goal-setting. Advocates of the practice have taken issue with his team’s use of such evidence as news accounts to support his conclusion that goal-setting is widely over-prescribed　　In a rebuttal (反驳) paper, Dr. Edwin Locke writes:“Goal-setting is not going away. Organizations cannot thrive without being focused on their desired end results any more than an individual can thrive without goals to provide a sense of purpose.”　　But Schweitzer contends the “mounting causal evidence” linking goal-setting and harmful behavior should be studied to help spotlight issues that merit caution and further investigation. “Even a few negative effects could be so large that they outweigh many positive effects,” he says.　　“Goal-setting does help coordinate and motivate people. My idea would be to combine that with careful oversight, a strong organizational culture, and make sure the goals that you use are going to be constructive and not significantly harm the organization,” Schweitzer says.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。　　52. What message does the author try to convey about goal-setting?　　A) Its negative effects have long been neglected.　　B) The goal increase people’s work efficiency.　　C) Its role has been largely underestimated.　　D) The goals most people set are unrealistic.　　53. What does Maurice Schweitzer want to show by citing the example of Enron?　　A) Setting realistic goals can turn a failing business into success.　　B) Businesses are less likely to succeed without setting realistic goals.　　C) Financial incentives ensure companies meet specific revenue goals.　　D) Goals with financial rewards have strong motivational power.　　54. How did Sears’ goal-setting affect its employees?　　A) They were obliged to work more hours to increase their sales.　　B) They competed with one another to attract more customers.　　C) They resorted to unethical practice to meet their sales quota.　　D) They improved their customer service on a companywide basis.　　55. What do advocates of goal-setting think of Schweitzer’s research?　　A) Its findings are not of much practical value.　　B) It exaggerates the side effects of goal-setting.　　C) Its conclusion is not based on solid scientific evidence.　　D) It runs counter to the existing literature on the subject.　　56. What is Schweitzer’s contention against Edwin Locke?　　A) The link between goal-setting and harmful behavior deserves further study.　　B) Goal-setting has become too deep-rooted in corporate culture.　　C) The positive effects of goal-setting outweigh its negative effects.　　D) Studying goal-setting can throw more light on successful business practices.　　Passage Two　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.　　For most of the 20th century,  asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West’s overly indebted and sluggish (经济滞长的) nations learn from a flourishing Asia?　　Just a few decades ago, Asia’s two giants were stagnating(停滞不前) under faulty economic ideologies. However, once  began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by  in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, “The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.”　　Contrast this middle path with  and , which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government---following Ronald Regan’s idea that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. “Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to “big government.”　　If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine, they would begin to see that the ’s problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country’s huge government deficit without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free  from its dependence on oil imports and create incentives for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation. American politicians will have to develop the courage to follow what is taught in all American public-policy schools: that there are good taxes and bad taxes. Asian countries have embraced this wisdom, and have built sound long-term fiscal (财政的) policies as a result.　　Meanwhile,  has fallen prey to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. Unlike the Americans, who felt that the markets knew best, the Europeans failed to anticipate how the markets would react to their endless borrowing. Today, the European Union is creating a $580 billion fund to ward off sovereign collapse. This will buy the EU time, but it will not solve the bloc’s larger problem.　　57. What has contributed to the rapid economic growth in  and ?　　A) Copying western-style economic behavior.　　B) Heavy reliance on the hand of government.　　C) Timely reform of government at all levels.　　D) Free market plus government intervention.　　58. What does Ronald Reagan mean by saying “government is the problem” (line4, Para. 3)?　　A) Many social evils are caused by wrong government policies.　　B) Many social problems arise from government’s inefficiency.　　C) Government action is key to solving economic problems.　　D) Government regulation hinders economic development.　　59. What stopped the American economy from collapsing in 2007?　　A) Self-regulatory repair mechanisms of the free market.　　B) Cooperation between the government and businesses.　　C) Abandonment of big government by the public.　　D) Effective measures adopted by the government.　　60. What is the author’s suggestion to the American public in face of the public government deficit?　　A) They urge the government to revise its existing public policies.　　B) They develop green energy to avoid dependence on oil import.　　C) They give up the idea of smaller government and less regulation.　　D) They put up with the inevitable sharp increase of different taxes.　　61. What’s the problem with the European Union?　　A) Conservative ideology.　　B) Shrinking market.　　C) Lack of resources.　　D) Excessive borrowing.　　Part V Close　　Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage.

Your essay should start with a brief description of the picture. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words.作文标准版The Impact of the Internet on Interpersonal CommunicationAs is described in the picture, a father asks her daughter how her school today goes on. Instead of answering directly, the daughter tells her father to read her blog. It is common that youngsters nowadays incline to communicate with others on internet increasingly, and lack communication with people around them. With the development of Internet, it has influenced our society to a large extent, especially interpersonal communication.  To begin with, we can communicate with others anytime via internet. Otherwise, we would have to arrange our schedules strictly in advance. Also, interpersonal communication through the internet is not restricted by space. For example, in most multinational corporations, instant messages and video conferences help colleagues solve problems timely and efficiently. Last but not least, the internet can greatly speed up our interpersonal communication. Whereas, there are also disadvantages that the internet brings to us. More and more people complained that they have lost face-to-face communicating skills. As a result, people become more and more indifferent to each other in real life. Some netizens who are immersed in virtual world even have difficulty in making friends in reality. In conclusion, communication through the internet could bring us both convenience and inconvenience. We should strike a balance between them and make the best of the internet. 作文高分版The Impact of the Internet on Interpersonal CommunicationToday I saw an interesting cartoon, in which a father asked his daughter about her school performance of the day, and the daughter replied that he could go to her blog to check it. This small cartoon indicates a big change in our life, especially the way people communicate.Internet enables people to break though the limitations of distance, strengthening social network.

The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish.M: Sounds terribly complicated.W: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn’t actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that  had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light.
M: So did it work?W: Well, amazingly enough, the dolphins achieved a 100 % success rate. Questions 19-21 are based on the conversation you have just heard.Q19.

 需要提醒考生的是，虽然考试中我们可以忽略一些人名，地名或者无关紧要的细节，这也是为了一时的应试而迫不得已。在平时练习中，还是建议广大考生多积累这些人文及百科知识，包括一些人名和地名。积累的多了，以后在任何场合听起来就不会犯难了。 Section B Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. Passage One Russell Fazio, an   psychology professor who has studied interracial roommates there and at , discovered an intriguing academic effect. In a study analyzing data on thousands of  freshmen who lived in dorms, he found that black freshmen who came to college with high standardized test scores earned better grades if they had a white roommate — even if the roommate’s test scores were low. The roommate’s race had no effect on the grades of white students or low-scoring black students. Perhaps, the study speculated, having a white roommate helps academically prepared black students adjust to a predominantly white university. That same study found that randomly assigned interracial roommates at  broke up before the end of the quarter about twice as often as same-race roommates. Because interracial roommate relationships are often problematic, Dr. Fazio said, many students would like to move out, but university housing policies may make it hard to leave. “At , where housing was not so tight, more interracial roommates split up,” he said. “Here at , where housing was tight, they were told to work it out. The most interesting thing we found was that if the relationship managed to continue for just 10 weeks, we could see an improvement in racial attitudes.” Dr. Fazio’s  study found that three times as many randomly assigned interracial roommates were no longer living together at the end of the semester, compared with white roommates. The interracial roommates spent less time together, and had fewer joint activities than the white pairs. Question 26-29 26. What do we know about Russell Fazio ?27. Who benefited from living with a white roommate according to Fazio’s study?28. What did the study find about randomly assigned interracial roommates at ?29. What did Dr. Fazio find interesting about interracial roommates who had lived together for 10 weeks? 答案：26, C. He specialized in interpersonal relationship.27. D. Black freshman with high standardized scores28, C. They broke up more often than same-race roommates29, C. The racial attitudes improved. 【解析】：本文节选自2009年7月的《纽约时报》，原文标题为Interracial Roommates Can Reduce Prejudice。文章属于社会类话题，大意为俄亥俄州立大学的一位名为Russell Fazio的心理学教授研究不同人种混居的有趣现象以及结论。无独有偶，2011年6月四级真题阅读理解Section B的Passage 1也选用了相同的话题，大家平时在备考中要对真题重视起来哦！ Passage twoIn a small laboratory at the Medical University of South Carolina, Dr. Vladimir Mironov has been working for a decade to grow meat. A developmental biologist and tissue engineer, Dr. Mironov, is one of only a few scientists worldwide involved in bioengineering 'cultured' meat.It's a product he believes could help solve future global food crises resulting from shrinking amounts of land available for growing meat the old-fashioned way.“Growth of cultured meat is also under way in the ”, Mironov told Reuters in an interview, “but in the , it is science in search of funding and demand.”The new National Institute of Food and Agriculture won't fund it, the National Institutes of Health won't fund it, and the NASA funded it only briefly, Mironov said."It's classic disruptive technology," Mironov said. "Bringing any new technology on the market, on average, costs $1 billion. We don't even have $1 million."Director of the  in the Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology at the medical university, Mironov now primarily conducts research on tissue engineering, or growing, of human organs."There's an unpleasant factor when people find out meat is grown in a lab. They don't like to associate technology with food," said Nicholas Genovese, a visiting scholar in cancer cell biology."But there are a lot of products that we eat today that are considered natural that are produced in a similar manner," Genovese said.30. What does Dr. Mironov think of bioengineering cultured meat?31. What does Dr. Mironov say about the funding for their research?32. What does Nicholas Genovese say about a lot of products we eat today? 答案：30, A. It will help solve the global food crisis.31, D. It is still far from being sufficient.32, D. They are not as natural as we believed. 【解析】这是路透社2011年初的一篇报道，题目为“South Carolina scientist works to grow meat in lab”。本文为食品科技类题材。大意为生物工程技术应用在实验室生产肉，可改变传统肉类获得方式，解决将来的食物危机，不过还需资金支持，同时人们还难以完全接受这种方式。 Passage three　Bernard Jackson is a free man today, but he has many bitter memories.  spent five years in prison after a jury wrongly convicted him of raping two women. At 's trial, although two witnesses testified that  was with them in another location at the times of the crimes, he was convicted anyway. Why? The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified  as the man who has attacked them. The court eventually freed  after the police found the man who had really committed the crimes.  was similar in appearance to the guilty man. The two women has made a mistake in identity. As a result,  has lost five years of his life.　The two women in this case were eyewitnesses. They clearly saw the man who attacked them, yet they mistakenly identified an innocent person. Similar incidents have occurred before. Eyewitnesses to other crimes have identified the wrong person in a police lineup or in photographs.　Many factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a lineup of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs or similar faces. The number of people in the lineup, and whether it is a live lineup or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them. Question 33: What do we learn about Bernard Jackson?Question 34: What led directly to ’s sentence?Question 35: What lesson do we learn from ’s case? 答案：33, A. He was wrongly imprisoned34, A. The two victims’ identification35, B. Many factors influence the accuracy of witness testimony. 【解析】    本篇文章讲述了Jackson因为被目击证人误认而被判刑，虽然最后洗清了罪名，但是却留下了惨痛的记忆。文章接着论述了为什么会出现这样的问题。可能是因为被害者对犯罪嫌疑人产生的混淆的记忆，或者在指认犯罪嫌疑人的过程中出现了不确定的情况。    虽然总体来说这篇文章难度不大，但是因为涉及专业知识，有一些词汇可能会成为考生的障碍。例如：testimony: 证人证言；witness: 目击证人；jury: 陪审团；sentence :刑期。如果考生平时能对这些单词有所接触，这篇文章在理解上就不会出现太大的问题。 Section C Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written. 答案：36. slight37. official38. shrinking39. plunge40. decline41. primary42. heads43. Poverty44. Hampered by higher taxes and weak demand for its exports, 's economy is seen only partially recovering this year.45. Mexico has historically had high drop-out rates as poor families pull kids out of school to help put food on the table，46. The nation's drop-out problem is just the latest bad news for the long-term competitiveness of the Mexican economy. 【解析】本篇文章谈论的是墨西哥失学率问题。文章先开篇阐述了墨西哥失学情况的现状，然后谈到这一现状的原因和所造成的严重后果。文中国家有关的Mexico、Mexican、Chile等部分考生可能不熟悉，而造成听力困扰，但这些实际并非考点，切记死盯部分词汇不放，而影响全篇理解。   最后，文中生词不多，实际内容对于喜欢阅读报刊杂志、关心时事热点的考生而言，能够根据日常经验有所预判。这就提醒考生，听力同样也需要平时多多进行报刊阅读。Part IV      Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)     (25 minutes) Section A Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements.

Part ⅣReading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)   (25 minutes)Section ADirection: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete stamens. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.Question 47 to 51 are based on the following passageHighly proficient musicianship is hard won. Although it’s often assumed musical ability us inherited, there’s abundant evidence that this isn’t the case. While it seems that at birth virtually everyone has perfect pitch, the reasons that one child is better than another are motivation and practice.Highly musical children were sung to more as infants and more encouraged to join in song games as kids than less musical ones, long before any musical ability could have been evident. Studies of classical musicians prove that the best ones practiced considerably more from childhood onwards than ordinary orchestral players, and this is because their parents were at them to put in the hours from a very young age.The same was true of children selected for entry to specialist music schools, compared with those who were rejected. The chosen children had parents who had very actively supervised music lessons and daily practice from young ages, giving up substantial periods of leisure time to take the children to lessons and concerts.The singer Michael Jackson’s story, although unusually brutal and extreme, is illumination when considering musical prodigy(天才). Accounts suggest that he was subjected to cruel beatings and emotional torture ,and that he was humiliated (羞辱) constantly by his father, What sets Jackson’s family apart is that his father used his reign of terror to train his children as musicians and dancers.On top of his extra ability Michael also had more drive. This may have been the result of being the closest of his brothers and sisters to his mother. “He seemed different to me from the other children —special,”Michael’s mother said of him. She may not have realized that treating her son as special may have been part of the reason be became like that.All in all, if you want to bring up a Mozart or Bach, the key factor is how hard you are prepared to crack the whip. Thankfully, most of us will probably settle for a bit of fun on the recorder and some ill-executed pieces of music-on the piano from our children.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。47. According to the author, a child’s musical ability has much to do with their ___.48.

Michael’s extra drive for music was partly due to the fact that he was ___ by his mother.51. To bring up a great musician like Mozart or Bach, willingness to be strict with your child is ___.Section BDirections:There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.Passage OneQuestions 52 to 56 are based pm the following passage.In 2011, many shoppers chose to avoid the frantic crowds and do their holiday shopping from the comfort of their computer. Sales at online retailers gained by more than 15%, making it the biggest season ever. But people are also returning those purchases at record rates, up 8% from last year.What went wrong? Is the lingering shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to accept extravagant indulgences? Or that people shop more impulsively—and therefore make bad decisions—when online? Both arguments are plausible. However, there is a third factor: a question of touch. We can love the look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of a texture, the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or, for that matter, the weight of an earring. And physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase.When my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the difference between the online and offline shopping experience. I carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways. The first was a fairly hands-off approach. Whenever a customer would inquire about my book, the volunteer would take them over to the shelf and point to it. Out of 20 such requests, six customers proceeded with the purchase.The second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and them subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer’s hands. Of the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it. Just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales. Why? We feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we hold things in our hand. That’s why we establish or reestablish connection by greeting strangers and friends with a handshake. In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might generate a subtle sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more.A recent study also revealed the power of touch, in this case when it came to conventional mail. A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered in a letter, as opposed to receiving the same message online. Brain imaging showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional center of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond. The study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession.This sense of ownership is simply not part of the equation in the online shopping experience.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。52. Why do people prefer shopping online according to the author?A) It is more comfortable and convenient.B) It saves them a lot of money and time.C) It offers them a lot more options and bargains.D) It gives them more time to think about their purchase.53. Why do more customers return their purchases bought online?A) They regretted indulging in costly items in the recession.B) They changed their mind by the time the goods were delivered.C) They had no chance to touch them when shopping online.D) They later found the quality of goods below their expectations.54. What is the purpose of author’s experiment?A) To test his hypothesis about online shopping.B) To find out people’s reaction to his recent book.C) To find ways to increase the sale of his new book.D) To try different approaches to sales promotion.55. How might people feel after letting go of something they held?A) A sense of disappointment        C) A subtle loss of interestB) More motivated to own it.         D) Less sensitive to its texture.56. What does train imaging in a recent study reveal?A) Conventional letters contain subtle messages.B) A lack of touch is the chief obstacle to e-commerce.C) Email lacks the potential to activate the brain.D) Physical touch helps form a sense of possession.Passage TwoQuestions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.Apparently everyone knows that global warming only makes climate more extreme. A hot, dry summer has triggered another flood of such claims. And, while many interests are at work, one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media: the notion of “extreme” climate simply makes for more compelling news.Consider Paul Krugman writing breathlessly in the New York Times about the “rising incidence of extreme events,” He claims that global warming caused the current drought in ’s , and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis.But the United Nations climate panel’s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite. For “North America there is medium confidence that there has an overall slight tendency toward less dryness” Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine; Climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048, at the earliest.And, fortunately, this year’s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis, as global rice and wheat supplies retain plentiful. Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: Prices have increased six-fold since 1969. so, while com futures(期货) did set a record of about S8 per bushel(葡式耳)in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970s, reaching 516 in1974.Finally, Krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that corn prices have skyrocketed since 2005. Nowadays 40 percent of corn grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol（乙醇）,which does absolutely nothing for the climate, but certainly distorts the price of corn—at the expense of many of the world’s poorest people.Bill Mickbben similarly worries in The Guardian about the  drought and corn prices. He confidently tells us that raging wildfires from  and  to  are “exactly” what the early stages of global warming look like.In fact, the latest overview of global wildfire suggests that fire intensity has declined over the past 70 years and is now close to its preindustrial level.When well-meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming, they often end up pitching beyond the facts. And, while this may seem justified by a noble goal, such “policy by people” tactics rarely work, and often backfire.Remember how, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Al Gore claimed that we were in store for ever more destructive hurricanes? Since then, hurricane incidence has dropped off the charts. Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement.That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。57. In what way do the media benefit from extreme weather?A) They can attract people’s attention to their reports.B) They can choose from a greater variety of topics.C) They can make themselves better known.D) They can give voice to different views.58. What is the author’s comment on Krugman’s claim about the current drought in ’s ?A) A time machine is needed to testify to its truth.B) It is based on an erroneous climate model.C) It will eventually get proof in 2048.D) There is no way to prove its validity.59. What is the chief reason for the rise in corn prices according to the author?A) Demand for food has been rising in the developing countries.B) A considerable portion of corn is used to produce green fuel.C) Climate change has caused corn yields to drop markedly.D) Inflation rates have been skyrocketing since the 1970s.60. What does the author say about global wildfire incidence over the past 70 years?A) It has got worse with the rise in extreme weathers.B) It signals the early stages of global warming.C) It has dropped greatly.D) It is related to drought.61. What does the author think of the exaggerated claims in the media about global warming?A) They are strategies to raise public awareness.B) They do a disservice to addressing the problem.C) They aggravate public distrust about science.D) They create confusion about climate change.Part Ⅴ ClozeThe continuous presentation of scary stories about global warming in the popular media makes us unnecessarily frightened. Even worse, it __62__ our kids.Al Gore famously __63__ how a sea-level rise of 20 feet would almost completely flood Florida, New York, Holland, and Shanghai, __64__the United Nations says that such a thing will not even happen, __65__ that sea levels will rise 20 times less than that.When __66__ with these exaggerations, some of us say that they are for a good cause, and surely __67__ is no harm done if the result is that we focus even more on tackling climate change.This __68__ is astonishingly wrong. Such exaggerations do plenty of harm. Worrying __69__ about global warming means that we worry less about other things, where we could do so much more good. We focus, __70 __, on global warming's impact on malaria (疟疾)-which will put slightly more people at __71__ in 100 years - instead of tackling the half a billion people __72__from malaria today with prevention and treatment policies that are much cheaper and dramatically more effective than carbon reduction would be.__73__ also wears out the public's willingness to tackle global warming. If the planet is __74__, people wonder, why do anything? A record 54% of American voters now believe the news media make global warming appear worse than it really is. A __75__ of people now believe – incorrectly – that global warming is not even caused by humans.But the __76__ cost of exaggeration, I believe, is the unnecessary alarm that it causes – particularly __77__ children. An article in The Washington Post cited nine-year-old Alyssa, who cries about the possibility of mass animal __78__ from global warming.The newspaper also reported that parents are __79__ "productive" outlets for their eight-year-olds' obsessions (忧心忡忡) with dying polar bears. They might be better off educating them and letting them know that, contrary __80__ common belief, the global polar bear population has doubled and perhaps even quadrupled (成为四倍) over the past half- century, to about 22,000. __81__ diminishing - and eventually disappearing - summer Arctic ice, polar bears will not become extinct.62.

C. terrifies 考查动词辨析。exhaust 表示“使筋疲力尽，用尽”；suppress表示“镇压，抑制”；terrify 表示“使惊吓”；disgust表示“使反感”。前文表明关于气候变暖的惊悚报道让我们感到恐惧，更糟糕的是，它吓到了我们的孩子们。63. D. depicted考查动词辨析。dismiss表示“开除，解散”；distract表示“使分心，分散”；deposit表示“储蓄，寄存”；depict表示“描绘，描述”。64. B. even though 考查连词。题考查考生对上下句关系的理解，上半句Al Gore讲述海平面上升20英尺会几乎完全淹没佛罗里达、纽约、荷兰和上海，后半句讲联合国说这种事不会发生，由此可见前后句是转折的关系，所以用even though，表示“尽管”；而as if表示“似乎”；in that表示“因为”；in case表示“以防”。65. C. estimating 考查动词。measure表示“测量，估量”；signify表示“意味，预示”；estimate表示“估计，预测”；extract表示“提取”。空格所在的句子说联合国认为淹没事件不会发生，同时预测海平面只会上升20英尺的二十分之一。66. A. Confronted 考查动词。be confronted with…为固定短语，表示“面临（困难、危险等）”。67. B. there 考查there be句型。由句中的连词and可知前后必须都是句子，表示某个现象或东西存在用there be句型。68. C. argument 考查名词。morality表示“道德，伦理”；interaction表示“相互沟通，相互作用”；argument表示“争论，辩论”；dialogue表示“对话”；文章前面两段都是在讲Al Gore与联合国不同的观点，因此这里填争论。69. D. excessively 考查副词辨析。prevalently表示“流行地，普遍地”；predictably 表示“可预言地”；expressively表示“意味深长地”；excessively表示“过度地，极度”。本句表达的意思是过度担心气候变暖意味着我们担心的其它事情会变少，而在这些事情上我们本可以做得更好。70. A. for example 考查固定短语。for example表示“例如”；in addition表示“另外，除此之外”；by contrast表示“相比之下”；in short表示“总之”；从上下文我们可以看出这句话是举例子，所以用for example。71. D. risk 考查固定短语。该题较为简单，at risk为固定短语，表示“有危险”。72. A. suffering 考查动词。suffer from表示“遭受；患……病”。73. C. Exaggeration 考查名词辨析。explanation表示“解释”；reservation表示“预约；预定”；exaggeration 表示“夸张”；revelation表示“启示”。本题显然承接上文提到的人们对于全球气候变暖这个问题过度夸张的情况。74. D. doomed 考查形容词辨析。dumped表示“废弃的”； dimmed表示“暗灰色的”；doubled表示“两倍的”；doomed表示“注定的；命定的”。这里表示人们假设如果地球的命运是注定好的，也就是说如果全球变暖这个问题是注定了的话，那么就不需要做任何事情来拯救，因为做了也没有用。75. B．majority 考查名词辨析。a majority of 表示“大多数的；mixture表示“混合”；quantity表示“质量”；quota表示“配额；限额”。76. B. worst 考查形容词辨析。前面文章一直在讲夸大全球变暖问题所带来的坏处，这里是作者想强调的最坏的代价，所以用worst。77. A. among 考查介词辨析。among表示“三者或三者以上之间”，among children表示“在孩子们当中”。78. D. extinction 考查名词辨析。separation表示“分离，分开”；sanction表示“制裁，处罚”；isolation表示“隔离，孤立”；extinction 表示“灭绝”。全球变暖只有可能会造成大量动物的灭绝，其他选项均不恰当。79. C. searching for 考查词组辨析。turn out 表示“生产；结果是”；tide over表示“克服，度过”；search for表示“寻找，搜索”；pull through表示“克服困难，渡过难关”。这里是说有些小孩子担心北极熊会灭绝，而这种担心显然对于他们来说是多余的，所以一些家长会寻找一些其他的东西来转移孩子们的注意力。80. B. to 考查介词辨析。contrary to为固定搭配，表示“与……相反”。81. A. Despite 考查介词辨析。despite表示“尽管”，后面一般跟doing；besides表示“此外，而且”；regardless of 表示“尽管，不管”；except表示“除……之外”。翻译参考答案：82.

Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.　High School Sports Aren’t Killing Academics　　A)In this month’s Atlantic cover article, “The Case Against High-School Sports,” Amanda Ripley argues that school-sponsored sports programs should be seriously cut. She writes that, unlike most countries that outperform the United States on international assessments, American schools put too much of an emphasis on athletics, “ Sports are embedded in American schools in a way they are not almost anywhere else,” she writes, “Yet this difference hardly ever comes up in domestic debates about America’s international mediocrity(平庸)in education.”　　B)American student-athletes reap many benefits from participating in sports, but the costs to the schools could outweigh their benefits, she argues, In particular, Ripley contends that sports crowd out the academic missions of schools: America should learn from South Korea and Finland and every other country at the top level of international test scores, all of whom emphasize athletics far less in school. ”Even in eighth grade, American kids spend more than twice the time Korean kids spend playing sports,” she writes, citing a 2010 study published in the Journal of Advanced Academics.　　C)It might well be true that sports are far more rooted in American high schools than in other countries. But our reading of international test scores finds no support for the argument against school athletics. Indeed, our own research and that of others lead us to make the opposite case. School-sponsored sports appear to provide benefits that seem to increase, not detract(减少)from, academic success.　　D)Ripley indulges a popular obsession(痴迷)with international test score comparisons, which show wide and frightening gaps between the United States and other countries. She ignores, however, the fact that states vary at least as much in test scores as do developed countries. A 2011 report from   shows that  produces math scores comparable to  and , while  scores are closer to . Ripley’s thesis about sports falls apart in light of this fact. Schools in  provide sports programs while schools in  do not. Schools in  may love football while in  interscholastic sports are nowhere near as prominent. Sports cannot explain these similarities in performance. They can’t explain international differences either.　　E)If it is true that sports undermine the academic mission of American schools, we would expect to see a negative relationship between the commitment to athletics and academic achievement. However, the ’s Daniel Bowen and Jay Greene actually find the opposite. They examine this relationship by analyzing schools’ sports winning percentages as well as student-athletic participation rates compared to graduation rates and standardized test score achievement over a five-year period for all public high schools in . Controlling for student poverty levels, demographics(人口统计状况), and district financial resources, both measures of a school’s commitment to athletics are significantly and positively related to lower dropout rates as well as higher test scores.　　F)On-the-field success and high participation in sports is not random-it requires focus and dedication to athletics. One might think this would lead schools obsessed with winning to deemphasize academics. Bowen and Greene’s results contradict that argument. A likely explanation for this seemingly counterintuitive(与直觉相反的)result is that success in sports programs actually facilitates or reflects greater social capital within a school’s community.　　G)Ripley cites the writings of renowned sociologist James Coleman, whose research in education was groundbreaking. Coleman in his early work held athletics in contempt, arguing that they crowded out schools’ academic missions. Ripley quotes his 1961 study, The Adolescent Society, where Coleman writes, “Altogether, the trophy(奖品)case would suggest to the innocent visitor that he was entering an athletic club, not an educational institution.”　　H)However, in later research Coleman would show how the success of schools is highly dependent on what he termed social capital, “the social networks, and the relationships between adults and children that are of value for the child’s growing up.”　　I)According to a 2013 evaluation conducted by the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago, a program called Becoming a Man-Sports Edition creates lasting improvements in the boys’ study habits and grade point averages. During the first year of the program, students were founds to be less likely to transfer schools or be engaged in violent crime. A year after the program, participants were less likely to have had an encounter with the juvenile justice system.　　J)If school-sponsored sports were completely eliminated tomorrow, many American students would still have opportunities to participate in organized athletics elsewhere, much like they do in countries such as , , and . The same is not certain when it comes to students from more disadvantaged backgrounds. In an overview of the research on non-school based after-school programs, researchers find that disadvantaged children participate in these programs at significantly lower rates. They find that low-income students have less access due to challenges with regard to transportation, non-nominal fees, and off-campus safety. Therefore, reducing or eliminating these opportunities would most likely deprive disadvantaged students of the benefits from athletic participation, not least of which is the opportunity to interact with positive role models outside of regular school hours.　　K)Another unfounded criticism that Ripley makes is bringing up the stereotype that athletic XX are typically lousy(蹩脚的)classroom teachers. “American principals, unlike the XX XX of principals around the world, make many hiring decisions with their sports teams in mind, which does not always end well for students,” she writes. Educators who seek employment at schools primarily for the purpose of coaching are likely to shirk(推卸)teaching responsibilities, the argument goes. Moreover, even in the cases where the employee is a teacher first and athletic coach second, the additional responsibilities that come with coaching likely comes at the expense of time otherwise spent on planning, grading, and communicating with parents and guardians.　　L)The data, however, do not seem to confirm this stereotype. In the most rigorous study on the classroom results of high school coaches, the  of ’s Anna Egalite finds that athletic coaches in  mostly tend to perform just as well as their non-coaching counterparts, with respect to raising student test scores. We do not doubt that teachers who also coach face serious tradeoffs that likely come at the expense of time they could dedicate to their academic obligations. However, as with sporting events, athletic coaches gain additional opportunities for communicating and serving as mentors(导师)that potentially help students succeed and make up for the costs of coaching commitments.　　M)If schools allow student-athletes to regularly miss out on instructional time for the sake of traveling to athletic competitions, that’s bad. However, such issues would be better addressed by changing school and state policies with regard to the scheduling of sporting events as opposed to total elimination. If the empirical evidence points to anything, it points towards school sponsored sports providing assets that are well worth the costs.　　N)Despite negative stereotypes about sports culture and Ripley’s presumption that academics and athletics are at odds with one another, we believe that the greater body of evidence shows that school-sponsored sports programs appear to benefit students. Successes on the playing field can carry over to the classroom and vice versa(反之亦然). More importantly, finding ways to increase school communities’ social capital is imperative to the success of the school as whole, not just the athletes.46.Stunets from low-income families have less access to off-campus sports programs.

　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. . You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 　　Passage one 
　　It is easy to miss amid the day-to-day headlines of global economic recession, but there is a less conspicuous kind of social upheaval(剧变)underway that is fast altering both the face of the planet and the way human beings live. That change is the rapid acceleration of urbanization. In 2008, for the first time in human history, more than half the world’s population was living in towns and cities. And as a recently published paper shows, the process of urbanization will only accelerate in the decades to come—with an enormous impact on biodiversity and potentially on climate change. 
　　As Karen Seto, the led author of the paper, points out, the wave of urbanization isn’t just about the migration of people into urban environments, but about the environments themselves becoming bigger to accommodate all those people. The rapid expansion of urban areas will have a huge impact on biodiversity hotspots and on carbon emissions in those urban areas. 
　　Humans are the ultimate invasive species—when the move into new territory, the often displace the wildlife that was already living there. And as land is cleared for those new cities—especially in the dense tropical forests—carbon will be released into the atmosphere as well. It’s true that as people in developing nations move from the countryside to the city, the shift may reduce the pressure on land, which could in turn be good for the environment. This is especially so in desperately poor countries, where residents in the countryside slash and burn forests each growing season to clear space for farming. But the real difference is that in developing nations, the move from rural areas to cities often leads to an accompanying increase in income — and that increase leads to an increase in the consumption of food and energy, which in turn causes a rise in carbon emissions. Getting enough to eat and enjoying the safety and comfort of living fully on the grid is certainly a good thing — but it does carry an environmental price. 
　　The urbanization wave can’t be stopped — and it shouldn’t be. But Seto’s paper does underscore the importance of managing that transition. If we do it the right way, we can reduce urbanization’s impact on the environment. “There’s an enormous opportunity here, and a lot of pressure and responsibility to think about how we urbanize,” says Seto. “One thing that’s clear is that we can’t build cities the way we have over the last couple of hundred years. The scale of this transition won’t allow that.” We’re headed towards an urban planet no matter what, but whether it becomes heaven or hell is up to us. 56. What issue does the author try to draw people’s attention to? 
A. The shrinking biodiversity worldwide. 
B. The rapid increase of world population. 
C. The ongoing global economic recession. 
D. The impact of accelerating urbanization.
57. In what sense are humans the ultimate invasive species? 
A. They are much greedier than other species. 
B. They are a unique species born to conquer. 
C. They force other species out of their territories. 
D. They have an urge to expand their living space.
58. In what way is urbanization in poor countries good for the environment? 
A. More land will be preserved for wildlife. 
B. The pressure on farmland will be lessened. 
C. Carbon emissions will be considerably reduced. 
D. Natural resources will be used more effectively.
59. What does the author say about living comfortably in the city? 
A. It incurs a high environmental price. 
B. It brings poverty and insecurity to an end. 
C. It causes a big change in people’s lifestyle. 
D. It narrows the gap between city and country.
60. What can be done to minimize the negative impact of urbanization according to Seto? 
A. Slowing down the speed of transition. 
B. Innovative use of advanced technology. 
C. Appropriate management of the process. 
D. Enhancing people’s sense of responsibility. 　　Passage Two 
　　When Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com in Feb. 2004, even he could not imagine the forces it would let loose. His intent was to connect college students. Facebook, which is what this website rapidly evolved into, ended up connecting the world. 
　　To the children of this connected era, the world is one giant social network. They are not bound — as were previous generations of humans — by what they were taught. They are only limited by their curiosity and ambition. During my childhood, all knowledge was local. You learned everything you knew from your parents, teachers, preachers, and friends. 
　　With the high-quality and timely information at their fingertips, today’s children are rising normally tame middle class is speaking up against social ills.  executives are being shamed into adding women to their boards. Political leaders are marshalling the energy of millions for elections and political causes. All of this is being done with social media technologies that Facebook and its competitors set free. 
　　As does every advancing technology, social media has created many new problems. It is commonly addictive and creates risks for younger users. Social media is used by extremists in the  and elsewhere to seek and brainwash recruits. And it exposes us and our friends to disagreeable spying. We may leave our lights on in the house when we are on vacation, but through social media we tell criminals exactly where we are, when we plan to return home, and how to blackmail(敲诈)us. 
　　Governments don’t need informers any more. Social media allows government agencies to spy on their own citizens. We record our thoughts, emotions, likes and dislikes on Facebook; we share our political views, social preferences, and plans. We post intimate photographs of ourselves. No spy agency or criminal organization could actively gather the type of data that we voluntarily post for them. 
　　The marketers are also seeing big opportunities. Amazon is trying to predict what we will order. Google is trying to judge our needs and wants based on our social-media profiles. We need to be aware of the risks and keep working to alleviate the dangers. 
Regardless of what social media people use, one thing is certain: we are in a period of accelerating change. The next decade will be even more amazing and unpredictable than the last. Just as no one could predict what would happen with social media in the last decade, no one can accurately predict where this technology will take us. I am optimistic, however, that a connected humanity will find a way to uplift itself. 61. What was the purpose of Facebook when it was first created? 
A. To help students connect with the outside world. 
B. To bring university students into closer contact. 
C. To help students learn to live in a connected era. 
D. To combine the world into an integral whole.
62. What difference does social media make to learning? 
A. Local knowledge and global knowledge will merge. 
B. Student will become more curious and ambitious. 
C. People are able to learn wherever they travel. 
D. Sources of information are greatly expanded.
63. What is the author’s greatest concern with social media technology? 
A. Individuals and organizations may use it for evil purposes. 
B. Government will find it hard to protect classified information. 
C. People may disclose their friends’ information unintentionally. 
D. People’s attention will be easily distracted 
from their work in hand.
64. What do businesses use social media for? 
A. Creating a good corporate image. 
B. Conducting large-scale market surveys. 
C. Anticipating the needs of customers. 
D. Minimizing possible risks and dangers.
65. What does the author think of social media as a whole? 
A. It will enable human society to advance at a faster pace. 
B. It will pose a grave threat to our traditional ways of life. 
C. It is bound to bring about another information revolution. 
D. It breaks down the final barriers in human communication. Part IV Translation
　　Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to translate a passage from Chinese into English. You should write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.　　翻译题一：自从1978年启动改革以来，中国已从计划经济转为以市场为基础的经济，经历了经济和社会的快速发展。平均10%的GDP增长已使五亿多人脱贫。联合国的“千年(millennium)发展目标”在中国均已达到或即将达到。目前，中国的第十二个五年规划强调发展服务业和解决环境及社会不平衡的问题。政府已设定目标减少污染，提高能源效率，改善得到教育和医保的机会，并扩大社会保障。中国现在7%的经济年增长目标表明政府是在重视生活质量而不是增长速度。　　翻译题二：反应在艺术和文学中的乡村生活理想是中国文明的重要特征。这在很大程度上归功于道家对自然的感情。传统中国画有两个最受青睐的主题，一是家庭生活的各种幸福场景，画中往往有老人在下棋饮茶，男人在耕耘收割，妇女在织布缝衣，小孩在户外玩耍。另一个则是乡村生活的种种乐趣，画有渔夫在湖上打渔，农夫在山上砍柴采药，或是书生坐在松树下吟诗作画。这两个主题可以分别代表儒家和道家的生活理想。　　翻译题三：中国将努力确保到2015年就业者接受过平均13.3年的教育。如果这一目标得以实现，今后大部分进入劳动力市场的人都需获得大学文凭。 
　　在未来几年，中国将着力增加职业学院的招生人数：除了关注高等教育外，还将寻找新的突破以确保教育制度更加公平。中国正在努力最佳地利用教育资源，这样农村和欠发达地区将获得更多的支持。 
　　教育部还决定改善欠发达地区学生的营养，并为外来务工人员的子女提供在城市接受教育的同等机会。参考答案作文部分：
　　【学历歧视：参考范文】
　　In the modern society, with competition becomes increasingly fierce, to find a job is too difficult for the young generation. Academic qualification, as a job a stepping-stone, is an essential factor during the job hunting.
　　Some people think that the highly educated must be able to find a good job, because education can prove that a person has a good capacity. Therefore, it is commonly believe that a job seeker with a master degree must be easier to find a promising job than a undergraduate. However, now the company interviewers generally prefer to required a even higher academic qualification, like a doctor degree. Otherwise, the applicants, even though he or she has tremendous potential, will be refused relentlessly.
　　As far as I am concerned, education should not be the single standard in an interview. As for the companies, it is not necessarily a good principle as well. Now the whole community often talk about working ability and efficiency. For example, some people may have high academic qualification, but actually his ability is very limited. So both the individual and the community ought to change their attitude on academic qualification. We should realize that it is the operational 　　【科技与学习：参考范文】
　　The picture vividly depicts that a teaching is asking a pupil to answer a simple math-related question——what’s two plus two? Unfortunately, the child cannot answer such an easy question without tech help. In fact, the phenomenon conveyed in the picture does not surprise us, because as the science and technology develops, the topic concerning the side effects of technological advancement increasingly arouses people’s attention. 
　　Undoubtedly, the drawer of the picture aims at reminding us that we should use technology in a proper way and not be too tech-dependent to solve the simple problem independently. It is well known that thanks to the development of human civilization, many formerly unimaginable things come into reality. But, while enjoying the convenience produced by tech, we must alert its harm. Being over-addicted to technology will cost our health, independence, wisdom，creativity and even our ability to live. 
　　Weighing the pros and cons of the technology, perhaps the best policy is to apply it properly. At the same time, we must avoid its harmful part. Furthermore, young people should be advised that depending too much on technology is hardly beneficial for them at all and more importantly they are expected to acquire the capacity to think independently.  　　【学习没有捷径：参考范文】
　　As is vividly depicted in the picture,before the circulation desk stands a student,who wants to find a shortcut to learning,with the librarian pointing it to him.On the lower part of the picture,we can see some English characters which read “' How To Do Well In School Without Studying' is over there in the fiction section”.
　　As to me, I think there is no shortcut to success,and the English characters under the picture also mean that the shortcut to success only exist in the virtual world.Whether you can do well in school is based on the effort that you spend on study.That is to say,the more diligent you are,the better your study is.Diligent is momentous and fundamental to people what the soul is vital and significant to us.Had it not been for it,we could not have been success.The story of Ma Yun,founder of China’s online trading empire,best prove the significance of diligent in realizing personal ambition and creating value to the world.
　　“The most crucial part of your life,”once wrote a distinguished professor, “is to cultivate the quality of diligent.”I was,and remains,the supporter of the idea that “There is no shortcut to learning.”　　听力部分：答案暂缺　　阅读理解部分：

　　[A]On the surface,Sweden appears to be a feminist paradise.Look at any global survey of gender equality and Sweden will be near the top.Family-friendly policies are its norm-with 16 months of paid parental leave,special protections for part-time workers,and state-subsidized preschools where,according to a government website,"gender-awareness education is increasingly common."due to an unfficial quota system,women hold 45 percent of positions in the swedish parliament.they have enjoyed the protection of government agencies with titles like the Ministry of Integration and Gender Equality and the Secretariat of Gender Research.So why are American women so far ahead of their Swedish counterparts in breaking through the glass ceiling?　　[B]in a 2012 report,the World Economic Forum found that when it comes to closing the gender gap in"econmic participation and opportunity,"the United States is ahead of not only Sweden but also Finland,Denmark,the Netherlands,Iceland,Germany,and the United Kingdom.Sweden's rank in the report can largely be explained by its political quota system.Though the United States has fewer women in the workorce(68 percent compared to Sweden's 77 percent).American women who choose to be employed are far more likely to work full-time and to hold high-level jobs as manangers or professionals.They also own more businesses,lauch more start-ups(新创办的企业),and more often work in traditionally male fields.As for breaking through the glass ceiling in business,American women are well in the lead.　　[C]what explains the American advantage?How can it be that societies like Sweden,where gender equality is vigorously pusued and engorced,have fewer female managers,executives,professionals,and business owners than eh laissez-faire(自由放任的)united states?A new study by clrnell economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn gives an explanation.　　[D]Generous parental leave policies and readily available part-time options have unintended consequences:instead of strengthening women's attachment to the workplace,they appear to weaken it.In addition to a 16-month leave,a swedish parent has the right to work six hours a day (for a reduced salary)until his or her child is eight years old.Mothers are far more likely than fathers to take advantage of this law,But extended leaves and part-time employment are known to be harmful to careers—for both genders. And with women a second factor comes into play:most seem to enjoy the flexible-time arrangement(once known as the “mommytrack”)and never find their way back to full-time or high-level employment.In sum:generous family-friendly policies do keep more women in the labor market,but they also tend to diminisb their careers.　　[E] According to Blau and Kahn,Swedish-style paternal(父亲的)leave policies and flexibletime arrangements pose a second threat to woman’s progress:they make employers cautious about hiring woman for full-time positions at all.Offering ajob to a man is the safer bet.He is far less likely to take a year of parental leave and then return on a reduced work schedule for the next eight years.　　[F]I became aware of the triale of career-focused European woman a few years ago when I met a post-doctoral student from  who was then a visiting fellow at Johns Hopkins. She was astonished by the professional possibilities afforded to young American woman. Her best hope in  was a govermment job—prospects for woman in the private sector were dim.”In  “ she told me,”we have all the benefits,”but employers don’t’ wan to hire us.”　　[G] Swedish economists Magnus Henrekson and Mikael Stenkula addressed the following question in their 2009 study:why are there so few female top executives in the European egalitarian(平等主义的)welfare states?Their answer:”Broad-based welfare-state policies hinder women’s representation in elite competitive positions.”　　[H] It is tempting to declare the Swedish policies regressive(退步的)and hail the American system as superior.But that would be shortsighted.The Swedes can certainly take a lesson from the  and look for ways to clear a path for their ambitious female careerists. But most woman are not committsd careerists.When the Pew Research Center recently asked American parents to identify their”ideal”life arrangement,47 percent of mothers said they would prefer to work park-time and 20percent said they would prefer not to work at all.Fathers answered differrntly:75 percent preferred full-time work.Some version of the Swedish system might work well for a majority of American parents,but the United States is unlikely to fully embrace the Swedish model. Still,we can learn from their experience.　　[I] Despite its failure to shatter the glass ceiling,Sweden has one of the most powerful and innovative economies in the world.In its 2011-2012survey,the World Economic Forum ranked Sweden as the “rockstar of the recovery”in the Washington Post,also leads the world in life satisfaction and happiness. It is a society well worth studying,and its efforts to conquer the gender gap impart a vital lesson—though not the lesson the Swedes had in mind。　　[J] Sweden has gone farther than any other nation on earth to integrate the sexes and to offer women the same opportunities and freedoms as men.For decades,these descendants of the Vikings have been trying to show the world that the right mix of enlinghtened policy.consciousness raising, and non-sexist child rearingwould close the gender divide once and for all.Yet the divide persists.　　[K] A 2012 press release from Statistics Sweden bears the title “Gender Equality in Sweden Treading(踩）Water” and notes:

　　1、The total income from employment for all ages is lower for women than for men.
　　2、One in three employed women and one in ten employed men work part-time.
　　3、Women's working time is influenced by the number and age of theirchildren, but men′s working time is not affected by these factors.
　　4、Of all employees，only 13 percent of the women and 12 percent of the men have occupations with an even distribution of the sexes.　　[L] Confronted with such facts, some Swedish activists and legislators are demanding more ex-treme and far-reaching measures, such as replacing male and female pronouns with a neutral alternative and monitoring children more closely to correct them when they gravitahta(被吸引) toward gendered play. When it came to light last year that mothers, far more than fathers, chose to stay home from work to care for their sick kids. Ulf Kristersson. minister of social security, quickly commissioned a study to determine the causcs of and possiiblce cures for this disturbing stale of affairs.　　[M]Swcdish family policies, by accommodating women's preferences efleetively, are reduting the number of women in elite competitive positions. The Swedes will find this paradoxical and try to find solutions. Let us hope these do not include banning gender pronouns, policing children′s play, implementing more gender quotas, or treating women′s special attachment to home and family as a social injustice. Most mothers do not aspire to (向往) elite, competitive full-time positions: the Swedish policies have given them the freedom and opportunity to live the lives they prefer. Americans should look past the gender rhetoric and consider what these Scandina-vians have achieved. On their way to creating a feminist paradise, the Swedes have uninten-tionally created a haven (避风港） for normal mortals.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。

Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A). B). C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 　　Passage One　　Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　Texting has long been bemoaned (哀叹）as the downfall of the written word,””penmanship for illiter,”as one critic called it. To which the proper response is LOL.
　　Texting properly isn′t writing at all. It′s a “spoken” language that is getting richer and more complex by the year.
　　First,some historical perspective. Writing was only invented 5,500 years ago. whereas Ianguage probably traces back at least 80.000 years. Thus talking came first; writing is just a craft that came along later. As such, the first writing was based on the way people talk，with short sentences.
　　However, while talking is largely subconscious and rapid, writing is deliberate and slow, Over time,writers took advantage of this and started cratting long-winded sentences such as this one:The whole engagement lasted above 12 hours, till the gradual retreat of the Per trsians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and……”
　　No one talks like that casually — or should. But it is natural to desire to do so for special occasions. In the old days, we didn’t much write like talking because there was no mechanism to reproduce the speed of conversation. But texting and instant messaging do — and a revolution has begun. It involves the crude mechanics of writing, but in its economy, spontaneity and even vulgaritv. texting is actually a new kind of talking, with its own kind of grammar and conventions.
　　Take LOL. It doesn’t actually mean “laughing out loud” in a literal sense anymore. LOL has evolved into something much subtler and sophisticated and is used even when nothing is remotely amusing. Jocelyn texts “Where have you been?” and Annabelle texts back ，LOL at the library studying for two hours.” LOL signals basic empath)’（同感)between tcxters. easing tension and creating a sense of equality. Instead of having a literal meaning, it docs something - conveying an attitude — just like the -cd ending conveys past tense rather than “meaning.，anything. LOL. of all things, is grammar.
　　Of course no one thinks about that consciously. But then most of communication operates without being noticed. Over time, the meaning of a word or an expression drifts meat used to mean any kind of food, silly used to mean, believe it or not，blessed.
　　Civilization, then，is fine 一 people banging away on their smartphones are fluently using a code separate from the one they use in actual writing, and there is no evidence that texting is ruining composition skills. Worldwide people speak differently from the w ay they write, and texting -quick, casual and only intended to be read once — is actually a way of talking with your fingers.56. What do critics say about texting?
A) It is mainly confined to youngsters
B) It competes with traditional writing.
C) It will ruin the wnttcn language.
D) It is often hard to understand.57. In what way does the author say writing is different from talking?
A) It is crafted with specific skills. 
C) It does not have as long a history.
B) It expresses ideas more accuratcly.
D) It is not as easy to comprehend.58. Why is LOL much used in tcxting?
A) It brings textcrs closer to each other.
B) It shows the tcxtcr's sophistication.
C) It is a trendy way to communicate
D) It adds to the humor of the text59. Examples like meat and silly are cited to show
A) the difTerencc between writing and talking
B) how difTercntly words are used in tcxting
C) why people use the words the way they do
D) the gradual change of word meaning60.what does the author think of texting?
A)It facilitates exchange of ideas among people.
B)It is a new form of verbal communication.
C)It deteriorates pelple's composition skills.
D)It hastens the decline of the written word.　　Passage Two　　Questions 61to 65are based on the following passage.
　　it's possible to admire oprah winfrey and still wish Harvard hadn't awarded her an honorary doctor of law degree and the commencement(毕业典礼)speaker spot at yesterday's graduation.There's no question Oprah's achievements place her in the  success stories. Talent,charm,and an exceptional work ethic have rarely hurled anyone of world's most successful entertainment icons and the first African-American female billionaire.
　　Honorary degrees are often conferred on non-academic leaders in the arts,business,and politics.Harvard's list in recent years has included Kofi fi Annan,Bill Gates,Meryl Streep,and David Souter.But Oprah's list in recent years has included Kofi Annan,Bill Gates,Mery1 Streep,and david souter.But Oprah's particular brand of celebrity is not a good fit for the values of a university whose motto（座右铭）,Veritas,means truth.Oprah's passionate advocacy extends,unfortunately,to a hearty embrace of fake science.Most notoriously,Oprah's validation of jenny McCarthy's claim that vaccines cause autism(自闭症)has no doubt contributed to much harm through the foolish avoidance of vaccines.
　　Famous people arc entitled to a few failings, like the rest of us. and the choice of commencement speakers often reflects a balance of insututional pnonties and aspirations. Judging from our conversations with many students. Oprah was a widely popular choice.
　　But this vote of confidence in Oprah sends a troubling message at precisely the time when American univereities need to do more to advance the cause of reason. As former Dean of Harvard College. Harry Lewis, noted in a blog post about his objections. “It seems vcrv odd for Harvard to honor such a high profile popularizer of the irrational…… at a time when political and religious nonsense so jeopardize the rule of reason in this allegedly enlightened democracy and around the world.”
　　As America′s oldest and most visible university. Harvard has a spccial opportunity to convey its respcct for science not only through its research and teaching programs but also in its public affirmation of evidence-based inquiry.
　　Unfortunately，many American universities seem awfully busy protecting their brand name and not nearly busy enough protecting the pursuit of knowledge. A recent article in The Harvard Crimson noted the shocking growth of Harvard′s public relations arm in the last five years and it questioned whether a focus on risk management and avoiding controversywas really the best outward-looking face of this great institution.
　　As American research universities begin to resemble profit centers and entertainment complexes, it’s easy to lose sight of their primary mission; to produce and spread knowledge.This mission depends on traditions of rational discourse and vigorous defense of the scientific method.Oprah Winfrey’s honoray doctorate was a step in the wrong direction.61.what do we learn about Oprah Winfrey from the passage?
A)She was a distinguished graduate of H arvard School of LaW.
B)She worked her way to success in the entertainment industry.
C)She used to abuse her children when she was a young mother.
D)She achieved her fame through persistent advocacy of fake science.62.Why does the author deem it inappropriate for Harvard to confer an honorary degree on Oprah winfrey?
A) She did not specialize in the study of law.
B)She was known as a supporter of fake science.
C)She was an icon of the entertainment industry
D)She had not distinguished herself academically.63.How did Harry Lewis react to Harvard’s decision in his blong post ?
A)He was strongly against it.
B)He considered it unpopular.
C)He thought it would help enhance Harvard’s reputation.
D)He thought it represented the will of the Harvard community.64.What is the author’s regret about many American universities?
A)They show inadequate respect for evidence-based inquiry
B)They fall short of expectations in teaching and research
C)They attach too much importance to public relations
D)They are tolerant of political and religious nonsense65.What does the author think a prestigious university like H arvard should focus on?
A)Cultivation of student creativity
B)Liberation of the human mind
C)Liberation of the human mind
D)Pursuit of knowledge and truthPart IV Translation (30minutes)　　翻译一：　　北京计划未来三年投资7，600亿元治理污染，从减少PM2.5排放入手，这一新公布的计划旨在减少四种主要污染源，包括500多万俩机动车的尾气（exhaust）排放、周边地区燃煤、来自北方的沙尘暴和本地的建筑灰尘。另有850亿元用于新建或升级城市垃圾处理和污水（sewage）处理设施，加上300亿元投资未来三年的植树造林（forestation） 市政府还计划建造一批水循环利用工厂，并制止违章建筑，以改善环境。另外，将更严厉地处罚违反限排规定的行为。　　翻译二：　　最近，中国科学院（Chinese A cademy of Sciences ） 出版了关于其最新科学发现与未来一年展望的年度系列报告。系列报告包括三部分：科学发展报告、高技术发展报告、中国可持续发展战略报告。第一份报告包含中国科学家的最新发现，诸如新粒子研究与H7N9病毒研究的突破，该报告还突出强调了未来几年需要关注的问题。第二份报告公布了一些应用科学研究的突破。该报告还突出强调了未来几年需要关注的问题。第二份报告公布了一些应用科学研究的热门领域。如3D打印和人造器官研究。第三份报告呼吁加强顶层设计，以消除工业升级中的结构性障碍，并促进节能减排。　　翻译三：　　中文热词通常反映社会变化和文化，有些在外国媒体上愈来愈流行。例如，土豪（tuhao）和大妈（dama）都是老词，但是已获取了新的意义。 土豪以前指欺压佃户和仆人的乡村地主，现在用于指花钱如流水或者喜欢炫耀财富的人，也就是说，土豪有钱，但没有品位。大妈是对中年妇女的称呼，但现在特指不久前金价下跌时大量购买黄精的中国妇女。 土豪和大妈可能会被人收入新版牛津（Oxford）英语词典，至今已有约120个中文词被加进了牛津英语词典，成为了英语语言的一部分。答案写作，略听力1.

This newly announced project aims to reduce four major sources of pollution, including exhaust from 5000 thousand motor vehicles, coal-burning in surrounding areas, sandstorms from the north and local construction dust. Another 85 billion yuan is used to build or upgrade the facilities of disposing garbage and sewage of the city. In addition, 30 billion to support afforestation programs in next three years.
　　The municipal government also plans to construct some plants to use cycle water, banning illegal constructions to modify the environment. Furthermore,  will punish those who violate the rules of emission-reduction more severely.【参考译文】　　 of Science recently published an annual report about its latest scientific findings and the prospect of the next year. The report consists of three parts: science development, more advanced technology development and the sustainable strategy of . The first one includes the latest findings of Chinese scientists, such as the research of new particle and the breakthrough in the study of H7N9 virus. Furthermore, it highlights some problems we need to focus in next few years. The second one announces some heated fields in applied science. For example, the 3-dimension print and the study of human organs. The third one suggests people enhance the top design in order to get rid of the structural obstacles in industrial upgrading and to promote the energy-saving and emission-reduction.【参考译文】　　The Chinese heated words usually reflect social changes and culture, some of which are increasingly popular with foreign media. Tuhao and dama, for example, are both old words, but they get different meanings now.
　　The word tuhao used to mean rural landlords who oppress their tenants and servants, while now it refers to people spending money without limits or those showing off all around. That is to say, tuhao owns money rather than taste. The word dama is used to describe middle-aged women. However, it is regarded as a special word to call those Chinese women who rushed to purchase gold when the gold price decreased sharply not long ago.

Into this empty casing, the teachers   26    stuff "education."     But genuine education, as Socrates knew more than two thousand years ago, is not    27    the stuffings of information into a person, but rather eliciting knowledge from him; it is the    28    of what is in the mind.     "The most important part of education," once wrote William Ernest Hocking, the   29    Harvard philosopher, "is this instruction of a man in what he has inside of him. And, as Edith Hamilton has reminded us, Socrates never said, "I know, learn from me." He said, rather, "Look into your own selvers and find the   30    of truth that God has put into every heart, and that only you can kindle (点燃) to a   31."      In a dialogue, Socrates takes an ignorant slave boy, without a day of    32, and proves to the amazed observers that the boy really "knows" geometry--because the principles of geometry are already in his mind, waiting to be called out.      So many of the discussions and   33    about the content of education are useless and inconclusive because they   34    what should "go into" the student rather than with what should be taken out, and how this can best be done.      The college student who once said to me, after a lecture, "I spend so much time studying that I don't have a chance to learn anything," was clearly expressing his    35    with the sausage-casing view of education.Part III                   Reading  Comprehension                   (40 minutes)Section ADirections: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on ,Answer Street 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.      Innovation, the elixir (灵丹妙药 ) of progress, has always cost people their jobs. In the Industrial Revolution hand weavers were   36    aside by the mechanical loom. Over the past 30 years the digital revolution has   37    many of the mid-skill jobs that supported 20th-century middle-class life. Typists,ticket agents, bank tellers and many production-line jobs have been dispensed with, just as the weavers were.      For those who believe that technological progress has made the world a better place, such disruption is a natural part of rising   38. Although innovation kills some jobs, it creates new and better ones, as a more   39    society becomes richer and its wealthier inhabitants demand more goods and services. A hundred years ago one in three American workers was   40    on a farm. Today less than 2% of them produce far more food. The millions freed from the land were not rendered   41, but found better- paid work as the economy grew more sophisticated. Today the pool of secretaries has   42, but there are ever more computer programmers and web designers.      Optimism remains the right starting-point, but for workers the dislocating effects of technology may make themselves evident faster than its   43. Even if new jobs and wonderful products emerge, in the short term income gaps will widen, causing huge social dislocation and perhaps even changing politics.Technology's   44    will feel like a tornado (旋风), hitting the rich world first, but    45 sweeping through poorer countries too. No government is prepared for it.注意:此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。A. benefits         F) jobless                    K) rhythmB. displaced        G) primarily                 L) sentimentsC. employed        H) productive                M) shrunkD. eventually       I) prosperity                 N) sweptE) impact           J) responsive                O) withdrawnSection BDirections: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.  Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.                     Why the Mona Lisa Stands Out　　A. Have you ever fallen for a novel and been amazed not to find it on lists of great books? Or walked around a sculpture renowned as a classic, struggling to see what the fuss is about? If so, you've probably pondered the question a psychologist, James Cutting, asked himself: How does a work of art come to be considered great?　　B. The intuitive answer is that some works of art are just great: of intrinsically superior quality. The paintings that win prime spots in galleries, get taught in classes and reproduced in books are the ones that have proved their artistic value over time. If you can't see they're superior, that's your problem.    It's an intimidatingly neat explanation. But some social scientists have been asking awkward questions of it, raising the possibility that artistic canons (名作目录) are little more than fossilised historical accidents.　　C. Cutting, a professor at Cornell University, wondered if a psychological mechanism known as the "mere-exposure effect" played a role in deciding which paintings rise to the top of the cultural league. Cutting designed an experiment to test his hunch (直觉). Over a lecture course he regularly showed undergraduates works of impressionism for two seconds at a time. Some of the paintings were canonical, included in art-history books. Others were lesser known but of comparable quality. These were exposed four times as often. Afterwards, the students preferred them to the canonical works, while a control group of students liked the canonical ones best. Cutting's students had grown to like those paintings more simply because they had seen them more.　　D. Cutting believes his experiment offers a clue as to how canons are formed.  He reproduced works of impressionism today tend to have been bought by five or six wealthy and influential collectors in the late 19th century. The preferences of these men bestowed (给予) prestige on certain works, which made the works more likely to be hung in galleries and printed in collections. The fame passed down the years, gaining momentum from mere exposure as it did so. The more people were exposed to, the more they liked it, and the more they liked it, the more it appeared in books, on posters and in big exhibitions. Meanwhile, academics and critics created sophisticated justifications for its preeminence (卓越). After all, it's not just the masses who tend to rate what they see more often more highly. As contemporary artists like Warhol and Damien Hirst have grasped, critics' praise is deeply entwined (交织) with publicity. "Scholars", Cutting argues, "are no different from the public in the effects of mere exposure."　　E. The process described by Cutting evokes a principle that the sociologist Duncan Watts calls "cumulative advantage": once a thing becomes popular, it will tend to become more popular still. A few years ago,Watts, who is employed by Microsoft to study the dynamics of social networks, had a similar experience to Cutting's in another Paris museum. After queuing to see the "Mona Lisa" in its climate- controlled bulletproof box at the Louvre, he came away puzzled: why was it considered so superior to the three other Leonardos in the previous chamber, to which nobody seemed to be paying the slightest attention?　　F. When Watts looked into the history of "the greatest painting of all time", he discovered that, for most of its life, the"Mona Lisa"remained in relative obscurity. In the 1850s, Leonardo da Vinci was considered no match for giants of Renaissance art like Titian and Raphael, whose works were worth almost ten times as much as the "Mona Lisa". It was only in the 20th century that Leonardo's portrait of his patron's wife rocketed to the number-one spot. What propelled it there wasn't a scholarly re-evaluation, but a theft.　　G. In 1911 a maintenance worker at the Louvre walked out of the museum with the "Mona Lisa" hidden under his smock (工作服). Parisians were shocked at the theft of a painting to which, until then, they had paid little attention. When the museum reopened, people queued to see the gap where the "Mona Lisa" had once hung in a way they had never done for the painting itself. From then on, the "Mona Lisa" came to represent Western culture itself.　　H. Although many have tried, it does seem improbable that the painting's unique status can be attributed entirely to the quality of its brushstrokes. It has been said that the subject's eyes follow the viewer around the room. But as the painting's biographer, Donald Sassoon, dryly notes, "In reality the effect can be obtained from any portrait." Duncan Watts proposes that the "Mona Lisa" is merely an extreme example of a general rule. Paintings, poems and pop songs are buoyed (使浮起) or events or preferences that turn into waves of influence, passing down the generations.　　I.  "Saying that cultural objects have value," Brian Eno once wrote, "is like saying that telephones have conversations." Nearly all the cultural objects we consume arrive wrapped in inherited opinion; our preferences are always, to some extent, someone else's. Visitors to the "Mona Lisa" know they are about to visit the greatest work of art ever and come away appropriately impressed--or let down. An audience at a performance of "Hamlet" know it is regarded as a work of genius, so that is what they mostly see. Watts even calls the preeminence of Shakespeare a "historical accident".　　J. Although the rigid high-low distinction fell apart in the 1960s, we still use culture as a badge of identity. Today's fashion for eclecticism (折中主义)  "I love Bach, Abba and Jay Z"  is, Shamus Khan, a Columbia University psychologist, argues, a new way for the middle class to distinguish themselves from what they perceive to be the narrow tastes of those beneath them in the social hierarchy.　　K. The intrinsic quality of a work of art is starting to seem like its least important attribute. But perhaps it's more significant than our social scientists allow. First of all, a work needs a certain quality to be eligible to be swept to the top of the pile. The "Mona Lisa" may not be a worthy world champion, but it was in the Louvre in the first place, and not by accident. Secondly, some stuff is simply better than other stuff. Read "Hamlet" after reading even the greatest of Shakespeare's contemporaries, and the difference may strike you as unarguable.　　L. A study in the British Journal of Aesthetics suggests that the exposure effect doesn't work the same way on everything, and points to a different conclusion about how canons are formed. The social scientists are right to say that we should be a little sceptical of greatness, and that we should always look in the next room. Great art and mediocrity (平庸) can get confused, even by experts. But that's why we need to see, and read, as much as we can. The more we're exposed to the good and the bad, the better we are at telling the difference. The eclecticists have it.　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。46. According to Duncan Watts, the superiority of the "Mona Lisa" to Leonardo's other works resulted from the cumulative advantage.47. Some social scientists have raised doubts about the intrinsic value of certain works of art.48. It is often random events or preferences that determine the fate of a piece of art.49. In his experiment, Cutting found that his subjects liked lesser known works because of more exposure.50. The author thinks the greatness of an art work still lies in its intrinsic value.51. It is true of critics as well as ordinary people that the popularity of artistic works is closely associated with publicity.52. We need to expose ourselves to more art and literature in order to tell the superior from the inferior.53. A study of the history of the greatest paintings suggests even a great work of art could experience years of neglect.54. Culture is still used as a mark to distinguish one social class from another.55. Opinions about and preferences for cultural objects are often inheritable.Section CDirections: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A. , B. , C. and D.. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet with a single line through the centre.Passage OneQuestions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.     When the right person is holding the right job at the right moment, that person's influence is greatly expanded. That is the position in which Janet Yellen, who is expected to be confirmed as the next chair of the Federal Reserve Bank (FeD. in January, now finds herself. If you believe, as many do, that unemployment is the major economic and social concern of our day, then it is no stretch to think Yellen is the most powerful person in the world right now.      Throughout the 2008 financial crisis and the recession and recovery that followed, central banks have taken on the role of stimulators of last resort, holding up the global economy with vast amounts of money in the form of asset buying. Yellen, previously a Fed vice chair, was one of the principal architects of the Fed's $ 3.8 trillion money dump. A star economist known for her groundbreaking work on labor markets, Yellen was a kind of prophetess early on in thc crisis for her warnings about the subprime (次级债) meltdown. Now it will be her job to get the Fed and the markets out of the biggest and most unconventional monetary program in history without derailing the fragile recovery.The good news is that Yellen,67, is particularly well suited to meet these challenges. She has a keen understanding of financial markets, an appreciation for their imperfections and a strong belief that human  suffering was more related to unemployment than anything else.      Some experts worry that Yellen will be inclined to chase unemployment to the neglect of inflation.But with wages still relatively flat and the economy increasingly divided between the well-off and the long-term unemployed, more people worry about the opposite, deflation (通货紧缩) that would aggravate the economy's problems.     Either way, the incoming Fed chief will have to walk a fine line in slowly ending the stimulus. It must be steady enough to deflate bubbles (去泡沫) and bring markets back down to earth but not so quick thatit creates another credit crisis.     Unlike many past Fed leaders, Yellen is not one to buy into the finance industry's argument that itshould be left alone to regulate itself. She knows all along the Fed has been too slack on regulation of finance. Yellen is likely to address the issue right after she pushes unemployment below 6%, stabilizes markets and makes sure that the recovery is more inclusive and robust. As Princeton Professor Alan Blinder says, "She's smart as a whip, deeply logical, willing to argue but also a good listener. She can persuade without creating hostility." All those traits will be useful as the global economy's new power player takes on its most annoying problems.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。56.

She is the most powerful Fed chief in history.Passage Two Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.       Air pollution is deteriorating in many places around the world. The fact that public parks in cities become crowded as soon as the sun shines proves that people long to breathe in green, open spaces. They do not all know what they are seeking but they flock there, nevertheless. And, in these surroundings, they are generally both peaceful and peaceable. It is rare to see people fighting in a garden. Perhaps struggle unfolds first, not at an economic or social level, but over the appropriation of air, essential to life itself.  If human beings can breathe and share air, they don't need to struggle with one another.       Unfortunately, in our western tradition, neither materialist nor idealist theoreticians give enough consideration to this basic condition for life. As for politicians, despite proposing curbs on environmental pollution, they have not yet called for it to be made a crime. Wealthy countries are even allowed to pollute if they pay for it.       But is our life worth anything other than money? The plant world shows us in silence what faithfulness to life consists of. It also helps us to a new beginning, urging us to care for our breath, not only at a vital but also at a spiritual level. The interdependence to which we must pay the closest attention is that whicl exists between ourselves and the plant world. Often described as "the lungs of the planet", the woods tha cover the earth offer us the gift of breathable air by releasing oxygen. But their capacity to renew the ai polluted by industry has long reached its limit. If we lack the air necessary for a healthy life, it is because we have filled it with chemicals and undercut the ability of plants to regenerate it. As we know, rapi deforestation combined with the massive burning of fossil fuels is an explosive recipe for an irreversibl disaster.     The fight over the appropriation of resources will lead the entire planet to hell unless humans learn t share life, both with each other and with plants. This task is simultaneously ethical and political because can be discharged only when each takes it upon herself or himself and only when it is accomplishe together with others. The lesson taught by plants is that sharing life expands and enhances the sphere c the living, while dividing life into so-called natural or human resources diminishes it. We must come t view the air, the plants and ourselves as the contributors to the preservation of life and growth, rathe than a web of quantifiable objects or productive potentialities at our disposal. Perhaps then we woulfinally begin to live, rather than being concerned with bare survival.注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。61.

But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel.W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real?M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. (14)Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expcasive to extract.W: Is that the most ~ reason to develdp alternative fuel and energy sources?M: There are two-v~y clear reasons to do so. (15)One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative efects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect.13.

(16)They not only have to know what is fashionable at the moment, but also have to guess what will become fashionable next season or next year. Most buyers work for just one department in a store.But the goods that Karen finds may be displayed and sold in several different sections of the store. (17)Her job involves buying handicrafts from all over the world. Last year, she made a trip to Morocco and returned with rugs, pots, dishes and pans. The year before, she visited Mexico and bought back hand-made table cloths, mirrors with frames of tin and paper flowers. The paper flowers are bright and colorful, so they were used to decorate the whole store. This year Karen is travelling in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Many of the countries that Karen visits have government offices that promote handicrafts. The officials are glad to cooperate with her by showing her the products that are available. Karen especially likes to visit markets in small towns and villages whenever she can arrange for it. She is always looking for interesting and unusual items. (18)Karen thinks she has the best job she could have found. She loves all the travelling that she has to do because she often visits markets and small out-of-the-way places.

(20)The area's city councilwoman was leading a discussion about how the quality of life was on the decline. The neighborhood faced many problems. Mark looked at the charts: taped to the walls.There were charts for parking problems, crime, and for problems in vacant buildings. Mark read from the charts, police patrols cut back, illegal parking up 20%. People were supposed to suggest solutions to the councilwoman. It was too much for Mark. (21)"The problems are too big," he thought. He turned to the man next to him and said, "I think this is a waste of my time. Nothing I could do would make a difference here." As he neared the bus stop on his way home, Mark saw a woman carrying a grocery bag and a baby. As Mark got closer, her other child, a little boy, suddenly darted into the street. The woman tried to reach for him, but as she moved, her bag shifted and the groceries started to fall out. Mark ran to take the boy's arm and led him back to his mother. "You gotta stay with morn," he said. Then he picked up the street groceries while the woman smiled in relief. "Thanks!" She said. "You've got great timing!  Just being neighborly," Mark said.As he rode home, he glanced at the poster near his seat in the bus. (22)"Small acts of kindness add up."

A study last year in The Lancet examined more than 11000 heart- attack sufferers from 52 countries. It found that in the year before their heart attacks, patients had been under significantly more strains than some 13000 healthy control subjects. Those strains came from work, family, financial troubles, depression and other causes. "Each of these factors individually was associated with increased risk," says Dr. Salim Yusuf, professor of medicine at Canada's McMaster University and senior investigator on the study~ "Together, they accounted for 30% of overall heart-attack risk." But people respond differently to high-pressure work situations. Whether it produces heart problems seems to depend on whether you have a sense of control over life, or live at the mercy of circumstances and superiors. (24)That was the experience of John O'Connell, a Rockford , Ill., laboratory manager, who suffered his first heart attack in 1996, at the age of 56. In the two years before, his mother and two of his children had suffered serious illnesses, and his job had been changed in the reorganization. "My life seemed completely out of control," he says. "I had no idea where I would end up." He ended up in hospital due to a block in his artery. Two months later, he had a triple bypass surgery. (25)A second heart attack when he was 58 left his doctor shaking his head. "There's nothing more we can do for you," doctors told him.23. What does the passage mainly discuss?B)【精析】推理判断题。短文开篇即提到了stress和heart disease，接下来，短文提到有研究表明，大多数心脏病患者的发病都与压力相关。在短文后半部分，以John 0’Connell的个人经历说明，他所经受的压力对他的心脏产生了严重的影响。24. What do we learn about John O'Connell's family?A)【精析】推理判断题。短文中提到，John 0’Connell在1996年首次心脏病发作，此前两年内，他的妈妈和两个孩子都患上了严重的疾病，他所工作的单位也经历了重组。因此，可以说在他发病前，他的家庭经历了一系列的不幸事件。25. What did John O'Connell's doctors tell him whenhe had a second heart attack?C)【精析】事实细节题。短文最后指出，当John0’Connell第二次病发时，医生们都摇头表示他们已经无能为力了。Section C26．are supposed to

A【文章来源】本文选自2014年1月18日刊登在The Economist(《经济学人》)上的一篇标题为“Coming to anOffice Near You”(《近在咫尺的威胁》)的文章。【结构框图】    创新是发展进步的灵丹妙药，经常导致人们失业。工业革命时期，机械织布机使手工纺织工人被扫地出门。在过去的三十年里，数码革命让很多中级技能工种消失了，而正是这些工作支撑了20世纪中产阶级的生活。打字员、票务代理、银行柜员还有很多生产线上的岗位都被摒弃了，就像纺织工人被摒弃了一样。    对于那些相信技术进步使世界更美好的人们，这种混乱是新兴利益的正常组成部分。虽然创新使一些工作消失，但也创造出新的及更好的工作，因为一个更高产的社会变得更加富裕，更加富裕的居民将会要求得到更多的产品和服务。一百年前，三分之一的美国工人受雇于农场工作。现在不到2％的美国工人却能生产出更多的粮食。这并没有导致从土地上解脱出来的数以百万计的人们失业，他们随着经济发展的愈加复杂化找到了薪水更高的工作。今天，秘书职位的数量减少了，但出现了更多的计算机程序员和网站设计师。    乐观仍然是正确的起点，但对工人来讲，技术的混乱效应可能比它的节奏明显更快。即使出现了新工作和极好的产品，短时期内收入差距还会加大，这将会造成巨大的社会混乱，甚至可能造成政治变革。技术的影响力就像一阵旋风，先吹过富国，最终也会掠过较为贫穷的国家。没有一个政府为之作好了准备。36．【考点】动词辨析题。N)【语法判断】空格位于系动词were之后，副词aside之前，据此推断应填入动词的过去分词，且该动词应可与aside构成固定搭配，所填入的词与were一起构成句子的谓语。【语义判断】根据首句可知，创新导致很多人失业。本句意思为“机械织布机使手工纺织工人失业”，故答案为swept“扫除，清除”，sweep aside为固定搭配，意思为“把……移到一边”。37．【考点】动词辨析题。B)【语法判断】空格位于has之后，名词词组many ofthe mid．skill jobs之前，故应填入动词过去分词，构成现在完成时。【语义判断】根据句意，在过去的三十年里，数码革命使很多中级技能工种___。下一句讲到，就像纺织工人被摒弃了一样，打字员、票务代理、银行柜员和很多生产线上的岗位都被摒弃了。由此推断，空格处应填入一个词表示中级技能工种消失。由此可知答案为displaced“取消”。38．【考点】名词辨析题。A)【语法判断】空格位于形容词risin9之后，应填入名词。【语义判断】第二段阐述了创新能创造新的工作岗位，这可以被看作是一种由创新带来的利益，故答案为benefits“利益；福利”。39．【考点】形容词辨析题。H)【语法判断】空格位于a more和society之间，故应填入形容词构成形容词比较级结构。【语义判断】根据句意，因为一个____更社会变得更加富裕，更加富裕的居民将会要求得到更多的产品和服务。接下来作者举例指出，现在不到2％的美国工人却生产出更多粮食，由此推断这是一个“高产的”社会，故答案为productive“多产的”。40．【考点】动词辨析题。C)【语法判断】空格位于系动词was之后，介词短语on a farm之前，应填入及物动词的过去分词构成被动语态。【语义判断】根据句意，三分之一的美国工人被____在农场里干活。选项提供的五个动词中，只剩下employed“雇用”，shrunk“萎缩”和withdrawn“退出；取消”还没有选，结合上下文语境可知答案为employed“雇用”。41．【考点】形容词辨析题。F)【语法判断】空格位于动词rendered之后，本题实际上是对render用法的考查。render后面加形容词，有“使……怎么样”的含义。【语义判断】前半句指出，这并没有导致从土地上解脱出来的数以百万计的人们___，后半旬接着指出这些人找到了薪水更高的工作。由此可知，这些人没有失业，故答案为jobless“失业的”。42．【考点】动词辨析题。M)【语法判断】空格位于助动词has之后，据此判断应填入动词过去分词，构成现在完成时。【语义判断】根据句意，秘书职位的数量___了，但出现了更多其他职位。由转折词but可知，前后两个分句是转折关系，其他职位增多，与之相反的是秘书职位的减少。由此可知答案为shrunk “萎缩”，“萎缩”这一概念可以表示数量的减少。43．【考点】名词辨析题。K)【语法判断】该空格位于形容词性物主代词its之后，应填入名词。【语义判断】根据句意，对工人来讲，技术的混乱效应比技术的节奏明显要快，由此可知答案为rhythm“节奏”。44．【考点】名词辨析题。E)【语法判断】该空格位于名词所有格之后，谓语动词之前，因此应填入名词作句子主语。【语义判断】根据句意，此处是指技术的影响力就像一阵旋风。由此可知答案为impact“影响力”。45．【考点】副词辨析题。D)【语法判断】该空格位于转折连词but之后，现在分词sweepin9之前，应填入副词。【语义判断】根据句意，此处是指技术的影响力就像一阵旋风，先吹过富国，最终也会掠过较为贫穷的国家，填入的副词应显示出时间发展的先后顺序。由此可知答案为eventually“最后”。Section B【文章来源】本文选自Intelligent L咖(《智慧生活》)杂志，2014年5／6月刊，标题为“Why the Mona Lisa Stands Out”(《为什么(蒙娜丽莎>能脱颖而出》)。【结构框图】参考译文    为什么《蒙娜丽莎》能脱颖而出A)  你是否曾痴迷于某部小说，却惊奇地发现这本书没有被列为名著?或者你是否曾在被誉为经典的雕塑旁徘徊不定，努力想看出它有什么名堂?如果是这样的话，你可能已经在仔细考虑心理学家詹姆斯·卡廷曾问过自己的问题：一件艺术作品是如何被认为伟大的?B)  出于直觉的答案是一些艺术作品确实伟大：就其本身而言是质量上乘的。随着时间的推移，那些能够占据画廊的主要展区，能够在学校被教授，并在各种书籍中重现再版的绘画已经证明了它们的艺术价值。如果你看不到它们的独到之处，那就是你自己的问题了。这样解释令人不安，也很高明。(47)但是，一些社会科学家对该解释提出了一些令人尴尬的问题，他们提出了这种可能性经典的艺术作品比僵化的历史事件强不了多少。C)  康奈尔大学的卡廷教授想知道被称为“单纯曝光效应”的心理机制在判断哪些作品是文化瑰宝方面是否发挥了作用。卡廷设计了一个实验来检验他的直觉。在讲课的过程中，他定期地给本科生看一些印象派的作品，每次看两秒钟。有些绘画是收录于艺术史书籍的经典之作，有些作品却没有这么出名，但质量可与那些经典之作媲美。第二类作品向学生展示的次数是第一类作品的四倍。(49)结果，这些学生更喜欢第二类作品，而对照组的学生则最喜欢经典之作。卡廷的学生之所以变得喜欢第二类作品仅仅是因为他们看到这些作品的次数更多。D)  卡廷认为他的实验为经典作品是如何产生的提供了线索。他指出，当今翻印最多的印象派作品大多在19世纪末被五六名富裕并有影响力的收藏家购买。这些人的喜好使某些作品享有盛誉，从而使这些作品更有可能挂在画廊里并作为收藏品被印刷。这种名气流传数年后，随着曝光率越来越高，名气势不可挡。人们看这些作品看得越多，就越喜欢这些作品，这些作品就会更多地出现在书籍、海报和大型展览上。同时，学者和评论家为这些作品的卓越创造了精准正当的理由。毕竟，不仅普通群众倾向于对那些曝光率高的作品评价更高。正如当代艺术家沃霍尔和达明·赫斯特所理解的那样，(51)评论家的赞誉和宣传息息相关。卡廷称：“从单纯的曝光效果来看，学者和民众的作用是一样的。”E)  (46)卡廷描述的过程启发社会学家邓肯·沃茨提出了一个原则，即“累积优势”：一旦某件事流行起来，这件事往往会变得更受欢迎。现在受聘于微软公司的沃茨研究社交网络的动力。几年前，他在巴黎的另外一家博物馆中也有过与卡廷类似的经历。他排队观看陈列在卢浮宫博物馆里控制温度的防弹箱中的《蒙娜丽莎》后，总是感到很困惑：(46)似乎没有人注意到达·芬奇还有另外三幅画陈列在上一个展厅，人们为什么认为《蒙娜丽莎》比那三幅画好呢?F)  (53)沃茨研究了“有史以来最伟大的油画”的历史后发现，《蒙娜丽莎》在大部分时期都相对来说没有名气。在19世纪50年代，人们认为达·芬奇赶不上文艺复兴时期提香和拉斐尔这样的艺术巨匠，他们作品的价值几乎是《蒙娜丽莎》的十倍。直到20世纪，达·芬奇所画的赞助人的妻子的画像才飙升至首要位置。造成这一现象的并不是学者的重新评估，而是一次盗窃。G)  1911年，卢浮宫的一个维护人员把《蒙娜丽莎》藏在工作服下面离开了博物馆。巴黎人得知这幅画失窃之后感到非常震惊，而在此之前，他们很少关注这幅画。博物馆重新开放时，人们排队去看《蒙娜丽莎》曾经悬挂的地方，而这幅画从没得到过这种礼遇。从那时起，《蒙娜丽莎》本身就代表了西方文化。H)尽管许多人作过尝试，这幅画能拥有如此殊荣似乎并不完全是因为其绘画技巧精湛。有人说画中人物的眼睛会跟着观赏人在房间里走。但正如该作品的传记作者唐纳德·萨松冷冷地指出：“在现实生活中，任何一幅肖像画都会产生这样的效果。”邓肯·沃茨提出，《蒙娜丽莎》仅是一般规则的一个极端例子。(48)绘画、诗词和流行歌曲会因一些产生影响的随机事件或人们的偏好载沉载浮，世代传承。I)  布莱恩·伊诺曾经写道：“说文物有价值，就像是在说电话能交谈。”(55)几乎我们所欣赏的所有文物都打着前人的观点烙印；在一定程度上，我们的喜好都是别人的喜好。去观赏《蒙娜丽莎》的游客知道他们将要欣赏到最伟大的艺术作品，离开时要么为之倾倒，要么失望。观看《哈姆雷特》演出的观众知道它被奉为天才的作品，他们大部分也会这么认为。沃茨甚至把莎士比亚的卓越也称为“偶然的历史事件”。J)  (54)虽然20世纪60年代就没有严格的等级区分了，人们仍然会用文化来象征身份。哥伦比亚大学心理学家夏姆斯·汗认为，如今流行的折中主义——“我爱巴赫、阿巴乐队以及Jay Z(美国最佳说唱歌手，译者注)——是中产阶级用来区分自己不同于那些他们认为品位单一的社会等级在他们之下的人的一种新手段。K)  (50)艺术作品的内在价值似乎正在变成最不重要的一个属性。但或许其重要性要高于社会科学家所认为的。首先，某个作品需要有一定的质量才能脱颖而出。《蒙娜丽莎》也许并不能世界顶级作品，但它是卢浮宫首屈一指的珍品，而这并不是偶然。其次，有些作品就是比其他作品更好。读过莎士比亚同时代作家的最伟大的著作之后，再阅读《哈姆雷特》，孰高孰低显而易见，无可争辩。L)《英国美学杂志》上的一项研究表明，“曝光效应”并不适用于所有的事物，并对经典作品的产生方式得出了不同的结论。社会科学家们说得对，我们应该对经典作品抱有适当的怀疑态度，并且我们应该经常看看隔壁展厅。甚至是专家也可能会分不清伟大的艺术和平庸的作品。(52)但是，这就是为什么我们需要尽可能地多看、多读。我们接触到的好东西和坏东西越多，就越能明白它们的区别。折中主义者就是这样。46．【定位1由题干中的Duncan Watts，superioritv和cumulative

Stops Here，，(《银行停止在这里》)的文章。【结构框图】参考译文    当一个适当的人在适当的时机得到合适的工作，他的影响力就可以得到巨大的延展。珍妮特．耶伦有望在一月份被确定为美联储下一任主席，她的职位就找到了适当的人选。(56)如果你像许多人一样，认为失业是我们这个时代主要的经济和社会关注点，那么认为耶伦是目前这个世界上最有权力的人物一点也不夸张。    (57)在2008年经济危机以及随后的衰退和复苏期间，中央银行承担了最后的经济刺激者的角色，通过巨额的资产买卖的方式擎起全球经济。耶伦曾是美联储的一个副主席，也是美联储3．8万亿资金库的主要创造者之一。作为一位以人力市场开拓工作著称的明星经济家，耶伦还曾经是对次级债消融的预警有早期预见能力的女预言家。现在，她的工作将是带领美联储和市场走出史上最大、最不寻常的金融项目，而又不会脱离脆弱的经济复苏的轨迹。    好消息是现年67岁的耶伦非常适合接受这些挑战。她对金融市场有准确的理解，她理解经济的不完美性并且坚定地相信人类的疾苦更主要的是与失业而不是其他因素相关。    一些专家担心耶伦会过度关注失业而忽视了通货膨胀。(58)但是，在薪金依然比较固定而富人与长期失业者的经济状况分化不断加剧的形势下，更多人的担心与前者恰恰相反—通货紧缩，这会加剧经济问题。    另一方面，这位未来的美联储主席将不得不找到适当的方法缓慢终止这一刺激。必须稳步推进，去除泡沫，实现市场着陆，又不能太快而造成另外一场经济危机。    (59)与以往的许多美联储领导人不同，耶伦不相信金融行业应该自我规范运行的论调。她一直就知道美联储对于经济的监管一直都过于松弛。    (59)耶伦很司能在将失业率降低到6％以下之后就着手解决这一问题，稳定市场并确保经济复苏更具包容性和生命力。(60)正如普林斯顿大学教授艾伦·布朗德所说：“她聪明得像鞭子，很有逻辑，乐于争辩，同时也是一个很好的倾听者。她能够劝服别人而又不会产生敌意。”所有这些特点都将是很有用的，因为这位全球经济的新掌权人需要解决最为棘手的问题。56．【定位】NN-P0的many people和the

public定位到第四段第二句。B)【精析】推理判断题。由第四段第一句可知，一些专家担心耶伦会忽视通货膨胀问题，而定位句反驳了这一观点，指出更多人担心的恰恰与之相反，即由于薪金相对比较固定，以及富人和长期失业者的经济差距不断加大，通货紧缩才是主要问题，故答案为B)。59．【定位】由题干中的the Fed chief以及题文同序原则定位到第六段。C)【精析】推理判断题。定位段指出，耶伦不相信金融行业能够自我规范运行，她认为美联济监管方面过于松弛。而随后的第七段首句也指出，她即将着手解决这一问题，故可推知她将要加紧金融制度，故答案为C)。60．【定位】由题干中的Alan Blinder定位到最后一段。A)【精析】推理判断题。定位段指出，艾伦·布朗德认为耶伦十分聪明，很有逻辑，乐于争辩也善于倾听，同时还能够在不让对方产生敌意的情况下劝服别人，可见她有很强的说服力，故答案为A)。    空气污染在全球很多地方正在变得日益严重。城市公园从日出之时就挤满了人，这证明人们是多么渴望在绿色、开阔的空间呼吸。虽然他们不见得都知道自己寻找的是什么，但他们还是聚集在那里。在那种环境中，他们一般会感觉到平静安详。在花园里极少会看见人们争斗。(61)也许争斗最初发生不是在经济或者社会层面，而是对空气占有方面，空气对生命本身是至关重要的。如果人类能够呼吸和分享空气，他们就没有必要相互争斗了。    不幸的是，在我们西方的传统中，无论唯物主义还是唯心主义理论家，对于这个生命的基本条件都没有给予充分的考虑。(62)至于政治家们，尽管他们建议控制环境污染，但并没有要求将污染环境人罪。富有的国家甚至获准污染环境，只要付钱就行。但是，我们的生命除了钱以外就没有其他有价值的东西了吗?植物世界无言地向我们展示了忠实于生命的内涵。它还引领我们来到一个新的起点，督促我们关注我们的呼吸，不仅在生命层面，还在精神层面。(63)我们需要密切关注的是存在于我们自身与植物世界之间的相互依赖。覆盖地球表面的森林常常被描述为“这个星球的肺”，它们通过释放氧气，向我们馈赠可呼吸的空气。但是，它们清洁被工业污染的空气的能力早已达到极限。如果我们缺少健康生活所需的空气，那是因为我们在其中充斥了化学物质并削弱了植被能使其再生的能力。正如我们所知的，快速地砍伐森林并伴随大规模的矿物燃烧是不可逆转的灾害的导火索。    (64)关于资源争夺的战争会把整个星球带入地狱，除非人类学会相互之间、与植被之间分享生活。这项任务同时具有道德和政治意义，因为只有在每个人都能够承担也只有在大家共同承担时，才能完成。(65)自然界教给我们的是，分享生活可以拓展生命空间，提升生命层次，而将生命分为所谓的自然和人类资源贬低了它。我们必须学会将空气、植被和我们自己视为保护生命和成长的贡献者，而不是任由我们支配量化物品和生产潜能的网络。也许到那时我们能最终学会生活，而不是仅仅关注生存。61．【定位】由题干中的struggle定位到首段最后两句。A)【精析】细节辨认题。定位句明确指出，争斗最初发生不是在经济或者社会层面，而是在对空气占有方面。如果人类能够呼吸和分享空气，也许就不会再彼此争斗，故答案为A)。62．【定位】由题干中的politicians定位到第二段第二句。D)【精析】推理判断题。由定位句可知，政治家们尽管建议控制环境污染，但并未要求将污染环境人罪，也就是说他们未能用法律手段限制环境污染，故答案为D)。63．【定位】根据题干中的closest attention定位到第三段第四句。B)【精析】细节辨认题。定位句明确指出，我们与植物世界相互依存，我们应该密切地关注这一点。换句话说，作者想要引起我们密切关注的是我们与植物世界相互依存的关系，故答案为B)。64．【定位】由题干中的accomplish及planet定位到第四段前两句。D)【精析】推理判断题。定位句说明，争夺资源的斗争会将我们的星球带人地狱，除非人类懂得相互之间、与植被之间分享生活，这一任务只有在每一个人都承担起责任并且大家共同承担时才能完成，可见要保护地球必须集合众人的努力，故答案为D)。65．【定位】由题干中的just to survive和题文同序原则定位到最后一段。C)【精析】推理判断题。由定位段可知，分享生活可以拓展生命空间，提升生命层次，我们要将空气、植被和我们自己均视为保护生命和成长的贡献者，而不是任由我们支配量化物品和生产潜能的网络，综合看来，与自然分享生命是实现生活层次提升至生存这一标准以上的根本途径，故答案为C)。Part IV    Translation     The  traditional  Chinese hospitality requires that the foods served are so diverse that guests cannot eat up all the dishes. A typical Chinese banquet menu includes cold1．翻译第一句时，可将“中国传统的待客之道”处理为句子的主语，将“饭菜丰富多样”处理为宾语，将“让客人吃不完”处理为结果状语。2．第二句中，“其后的热菜”可参考译文采用被动语态followed by dishes served at the beginning, followed by hot  dishes,  such  as  meat,  poultry,vegetables, and so on.

Desserts and fruit usually mark the end of the banquet. hot dishes，也可翻译为独立主格结构作伴随状语，即with the hot dishes followed；“例如肉类、鸡鸭、蔬菜等”是对“热菜”的举例说明，用such as引导。3．第三句中的“全鱼被认为是……”可用被动语态，“必不可少的”可译为essential或indispensable，“除非……”表明该句包含一个条件状语从句，可用unless引导。4．第五句包含一个让步状语从句，表示“尽管”含义的让步状语从句常见的引导词有though，although，despite等；“流行”的表达方式有很多，如prevalent，popular，fashionable，catch on等。因此，本句也可以译为Despite the fact that traditionally Chinese people don’t like to eat any dishes without cookin9，salad has also been popular。5．翻译第六句中的“可以最先或最后上桌”时可处理为独立主格结构。最后一句的翻译相对简单，“标志……的结束”可用短语mark the end of…来表达。cordial hospitality 盛情款待the way to host visitors 待客之道cuisine 烹饪a sumptuous feast 丰盛的宴席dinner party 晚餐派对western-style food 西餐
