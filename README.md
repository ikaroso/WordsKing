Calculate words frequency in CET and TEM, in VOA, BBC. 


Try to find the relationship among frequency, meaning and difficulty.


Evaluate the vocabulary quantity of a person by implementing other's paper.


Want to find a practicable way for all the questions above.


|----------------------Current Achievements--------------------|


1.Find realated data like CET-4 and CET-6.


2.Calculate the words frequnecy for each data set and store them in different tables of a DB.

3.(Need to do right now) Connect those tables to make a new table.

   In this new table, all word are stored without repetation.
   
   And it is okay that some tuples have NULL value in some columns.
   
   Actually this is the difficlut part, i dont know how to do it now.

|-------------------------------To do List-------------------------|

1. Get rid of the dirty data (This can be done after i built the final DB).







2.Find a algorithm that can combine all the frequency together to make evaluating the difficulty of a word possible.



3.Given some words and generate a reasonable paragraph which contains all the given words.
